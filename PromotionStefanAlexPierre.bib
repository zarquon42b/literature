  Abstract                 = {Many adverse environmental and genetic factors can affect stability of development during human growth. Although the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) may be influenced by environmental and genetic stress encountered during this period, directional asymmetry (DA) is largely attributable to differential mechanical loading during bone growth, for example, handedness. I assessed the effects of heavy working conditions and socioeconomic conditions on asymmetry levels in three groups of young human males: 1) individuals employed in the heavy industry sector (n = 104, mean age = 18.48 {\^A}± 0.61 years), 2) individuals who had the same socioeconomic status as the laborers (n = 102, mean age = 18.39 {\^A}± 0.58 years) but were not laborers, and 3) nonlaborers from the higher socioeconomic levels of society (n = 103, mean age = 18.43± 0.67). For all subjects, hand length, hand width, elbow width, wrist width, knee width, ankle width, foot length, foot width, ear length, and ear width were measured. All measurements of the upper extremities in the labor group appeared to exhibit DA; in the other two groups only hand measurements exhibited DA. According to analysis of FA, subjects living in poor conditions exhibited more FA than their nonlaborer peers living in better conditions. In addition, biomechanical pressures due to heavy working conditions of the labor group appeared to cause increased DA in the upper extremities: DA increased with an increase in the number of years working.

Models were constructed from 222 cranial CT scans of U.S. Whites from the Bass Donated Collection. These models were used to create a statistical bone atlas that captures the primary shape variation in the skull and facilitates rapid computer-automated analyses. The bone atlas showed that important size-related sex variables are bizygomatic breadth, maximum cranial length, cranial base length, and mastoid height. Shape-related variables capture sex differences in the projection of the glabellar region, inclination of the frontal, and cranial base flexion. In addition, vault thickness is highly dimorphic, with females having on average thicker vaults in the frontal region, and males having thicker vaults in the occipital region. Cross-validated linear discriminant analysis obtained >95% accuracy (97.5% with 11 variables and 95.5% with eight variables).},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents a novel three-dimensional analysis using statistical atlases and automated measurements to assess diaphyseal morphology of the clavicle and its relationship to muscle asymmetry. A sample of 505 individuals (285 males, 220 females) from the William McCormick Clavicle Collection was CT scanned, segmented, and added to a statistical bone atlas that captures correspondence between homologous points on the bone surfaces. Muscle attachment sites were localized on the atlas and then propagated across the entire population. Cross-sectional contours were extracted at 5\% increments along the entire bone, as well as at muscle attachment sites and the clavicle waist; maximum and minimum dimensions of each cross-sectional contour were calculated. In addition, the entire three-dimensional surface was examined for asymmetry by analyzing the magnitude and directional differences between homologous points across all bone surfaces in the dataset. The results confirm the existing studies on clavicle asymmetry, namely that the left clavicle is longer than the right, but the right is more robust than the left. However, the patterns of asymmetry are sexually dimorphic. Males are significantly asymmetric in all dimensions and at muscle and ligament attachment sites (P < 0.05), whereas female asymmetry is more variable. We hypothesize that this is related to absolute and relative differences in male muscle strength compared to females. However, an area with no muscle attachments on the posterior midshaft was significantly asymmetric in both sexes. We suggest that this is a curvature difference caused by opposing muscle actions at the medial and lateral ends of the bone. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012. {\^A}© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial least squares (PLS) regression (a.k.a. projection on latent structures) is a recent technique that combines features from and generalizes principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression. Its goal is to predict a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors. This prediction is achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors called latent variables which have the best predictive power. These latent variables can be used to create displays akin to PCA displays. The quality of the prediction obtained from a PLS regression model is evaluated with cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and jackknife. There are two main variants of PLS regression: The most common one separates the roles of dependent and independent variables; the second one-used mostly to analyze brain imaging data gives the same roles to dependent and independent variables.

  Abstract                 = {Introduction: To describe the morphometric and geometric relationships of the orbital floor in a Caucasian population. Materials and Methods: Exenterations of 47 orbits from 24 formalin fixed cadavers were performed. Morphometric measurements were taken between anatomical landmarks located along the orbital floor and the orbital apex. The mean measurements were used to calculate geometric data. These results were analysed according to sex and side and compared to results from other ethnic populations. Results: The average distances from the infraorbital foramen to the nasolacrimal fossa, inferior orbital fissure, optic canal and inferior orbital rim were 20.67 mm (2.42), 25.40 mm (2.70), 43.23 mm (3.35) and 8.95 mm (1.53), respectively. The average distances from the tip of the infraorbital groove to the tip of the inferior orbital fissure, lateral aspect of the inferomedial strut, optic canal and the intersection with the inferior orbital fissure were 14.08 mm (2.41), 12.12 mm (2.42), 35.02 mm (3.17) and 20.05 mm (2.87), respectively. The distances from the tip of the inferior orbital fissure to the optic canal and the intersection with the inferior orbital groove were 29.56 mm (2.73) and 13.37 mm (2.76), respectively. Discussion: Orbital surgeons should be aware of the morphometric relationships of the orbital floor due to the degree of variation that exists between different ethnic groups. Geometric data may be used to provide orbital surgeons with a navigational template that can be used to plan surgery and as a guide intraoperatively. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  Abstract                 = {Although ophthalmoscopy, fluoro-angiography and ultrasound can usually identify most bulbar lesions, CT and MR play a major role in assessing the bony orbital structures and the post-bulbar soft tissues. These imaging techniques are especially important in investigating the eyeball under conditions "blind" to ultrasound not transparent to dioptric instruments (blood in the vitreous body, cataract, corneal opacity) or to define the site and extension and sometimes the nature (melanoma) of tumours. Whereas both CT and MR are completely reliable techniques in the study of the orbit, overall CT is decidedly superior to MR in the study of bony structures and MR is the method of choice in assessing the endo-orbital contents This is because MR offers better spatial resolution and contrast with multiplanar views (allowing study on three planes without requiring the patient to assume uncomfortable positions far coronal CT scanning), greater sensitivity to tissue changes and hence diseases, the lack of signal from bony tissue (displaying the content of small structures like the orbital apex, nasolacrimal fossa and optic canal which are difficult to assess by CT due to artefacts) and lastly, the absence of ionizing radiation in examining children. These advantages are flanked by the use of the fast-imaging technique and surface coils (phased-array) which have overcome the limitations originally linked with MR due to the prolonged examination times and images degraded by artefacts. Nowadays, the only obstacle to routine use of MR is the shortage of MR systems in Italy. For both MR and CT scanning, technological developments have led to significant advances with the advent of the spiral technique which reduces the artefacts of eyeball movements because anatomical volumes can be investigated rapidly, improving patient compliance (in acquiring coronal scans) and enhancing the qualify of two and three-dimensional reconstructions and allowing optimum use of contrast medium as the structure can be scanned during the maximum increase phase with a reduction in the total amount of contrast administered Although the spiral technique is seldom used to examine the orbit in adults given the small volume to investigate, it is particular indicated in uncooperative patients (children or trauma patients).},

Recently, however, Goldberg and Lande (2006) pointed out that when phenotypic characters vary along an environmental gradient, the standard approach may fail to identify sympatric character divergence. Here we present a general analytical procedure for identifying sympatric character divergence while accounting for phenotypic changes that covary with environmental variables. Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric character divergence when they are present, and does not identify such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for other covariates and sources of variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Many evolutionary studies require an understanding of phenotypic change. However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution. The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of Globorotalia.},

  Abstract                 = {Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain patterns of shape variation and its covariation with other variables. Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform.},

  Abstract                 = {A conceptual framework that allows faces to be studied and compared objectively with biological validity is presented. The framework is a logical extension of modern morphometrics and statistical shape analysis techniques. Three dimensional (3D) facial scans were collected from 255 healthy young adults. One scan depicted a smiling facial expression and another scan depicted a neutral expression. These facial scans were modelled in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) space where Euclidean (ED) and Mahalanobis (MD) distances were used to form similarity measures. Within this PCA space, property pathways were calculated that expressed the direction of change in facial expression. Decomposition of distances into property-independent (D1) and dependent components (D2) along these pathways enabled the comparison of two faces in terms of the extent of a smiling expression. The performance of all distances was tested and compared in dual types of experiments: Classification tasks and a Recognition task. In the Classification tasks, individual facial scans were assigned to one or more population groups of smiling or neutral scans. The property-dependent (D2) component of both Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances performed best in the Classification task, by correctly assigning 99.8% of scans to the right population group. The recognition task tested if a scan of an individual depicting a smiling/neutral expression could be positively identified when shown a scan of the same person depicting a neutral/smiling expression. ED1 and MD1 performed best, and correctly identified 97.8% and 94.8% of individual scans respectively as belonging to the same person despite differences in facial expression. It was concluded that decomposed components are superior to straightforward distances in achieving positive identifications and presents a novel method for quantifying facial similarity. Additionally, although the undecomposed Mahalanobis distance often used in practice outperformed that of the Euclidean, it was the opposite result for the decomposed distances.},

  Abstract                 = {SummaryPurpose To establish the pattern of change in globe protrusion with advancing age. The findings contribute to our understanding of orbital ageing, and are useful in the longitudinal assessment of patients with orbital disease, craniofacial abnormalities and trauma. Methods Ocular protrusion from the lateral orbital rim to the corneal apex was measured in 653 Caucasians aged 21-80 years. Healthy subjects only were included in the study excluding those with ocular or orbital diseases. Measurements were taken using a single instrument and observer. Data were analysed for both sexes and each eye separately. Results The mean exophthalmometry reading in both sexes (318 female and 335 male) was 19± 2 mm. Ninety-eight percent of readings between the two eyes were within 1 mm of each other and no subject had greater than 2 mm of asymmetry. In all groups there was a negative linear correlation between ocular protrusion and age. This correlation was found to be highly statistically significant in all groups (r = 0.56-0.65, p 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between change in ocular protrusion with age between the left and right eye for females or males.},

We believe that this scheme will be particularly useful in studying the data of paleontology and comparative morphology and in the analysis of processes leading to adaptive radiation. We illustrate this scheme by examples drawn from the literature and our own work.},

We present findings on environmental and innate influences on face aging, facial soft tissue age changes, and bony changes in the craniofacial and dentoalveolar skeleton.

  Abstract                 = {Laterality is fundamental to the vertebrate body plan. Here, we investigate the roles of fgf8 signaling in LR patterning of the zebrafish embryo. We find that fgf8 is required for proper asymmetric development of the brain, heart and gut. When fgf8 is absent, nodal signaling is randomized in the lateral plate mesoderm, leading to aberrant LR orientation of the brain and visceral organs. We also show that fgf8 is necessary for proper symmetric development of the pharyngeal skeleton. Attenuated fgf8 signaling results in consistently biased LR asymmetric development of the pharyngeal arches and craniofacial skeleton. Approximately 1/3 of zebrafish ace/fgf8 mutants are missing Kupffer's vesicle (KV), a ciliated structure similar to Hensen's node. We correlate fgf8 deficient laterality defects in the brain and viscera with the absence of KV, supporting a role for KV in proper LR patterning of these structures. Strikingly, we also correlate asymmetric craniofacial development in ace/fgf8 mutants with the presence of KV, suggesting roles for KV in lateralization of the pharyngeal skeleton when fgf8 is absent. These data provide new insights into vertebrate laterality and offer the zebrafish ace/fgf8 mutant as a novel molecular tool to investigate tissue-specific molecular laterality mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Canonical variate analysis and generalized distances are commonly used multivariate statistical techniques for assessing the comparative morphology of living and fossil primates. Some common pitfalls of these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities), and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances, the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer canonical variates are emphasized. Simple examples taken from the literature illustrate how the different approaches to including a fosil in canonical variate analysis may affect the multivariate results upon which physical anthropologists base their interpretations of the fossil's morphology.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to develop a three-dimensional finite-element model (FEM) of the human orbit, containing the globe, to predict orbital deformation in subjects following a blunt injury. This study investigated the hypothesis that such deformation could be modelled using finite-element techniques. One patient who had CT-scan examination to the maxillofacial skeleton including the orbits, as part of her treatment, was selected for this study. A FEM of one of the orbits containing the globe was constructed, based on CT-scan images. Simulations were performed with a computer using the finite-element software NISA (EMRC, Troy, USA). The orbit was subjected to a blunt injury of a 0.5kg missile with 30 velocity. The FEM was then used to predict principal and shear stresses or strains at each node position. Two types of orbital deformation were predicted during different impact simulations: (i) horizontal distortion and (ii) rotational distortion. Stress values ranged from 213.4 to 363.3MPa for the maximum principal stress, from 327.8 to 653.1MPa for the minimum principal stress, and from 212.3 to 444.3MPa for the maximum shear stress. This is the first finite-element study, which demonstrates different and concurrent patterns of orbital deformation in a subject following a blunt injury. Finite element modelling is a powerful and invaluable tool to study the multifaceted phenomenon of orbital deformation.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how to extend the ICP framework to nonrigid registration, while retaining the convergence properties of the original algorithm. The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly. It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms using synthetic examples and real world data.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose To identify factors influencing the volumetric correction of orbital fractures, and evaluate the use of prefabricated titanium mesh in their repair. Materials and Methods We included patients with unilateral orbital fractures and floor or medial-wall defects, subsequently reconstructed with titanium mesh, and subject to adequate follow-up with multislice, digitalized computed tomography (CT) images. Medical records were reviewed, and demographics, operative details, and postoperative course were recorded as prognostic variables. Moreover, orbital volume, apex-to-globe distance, and orbital rim area were measured using postoperative CT. Univariate analysis and a multiple-regression model were used to identify associated factors. Results A total of 32 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Postoperative clinical evaluation and CT images were obtained in a mean ± SD of 12.3 7.2 months after surgery. Clinically, 20 patients were considered normal (63%), and 12 manifested some ocular dystopia (37%). On postoperative CT, the mesh was in good position in 44% of cases, and in an insufficient position in 56% of cases. There was a significant difference between fractured and normal orbits in relation to orbital volume and apex-globe distance. Clinical evaluation significantly correlated with CT mesh placement, but there was no correlation between clinical evaluation and any of the variables measured on CT. The most important factors influencing postoperative orbital volume correction were type of fracture, affected walls, and use of prefabricated mesh. Conclusion Volumetric and lineal symmetry between fractured and normal orbits are very difficult to achieve. In this study, postoperative CT measurements did not correlate with subjective clinical assessment. The clinical-radiological disagreement may be explained by measurement accuracy problems, clinical bias, or normal differences between orbits. The most important identified modifiable factor was the use of prefabricated mesh.},

The skin and the skull models are constructed from 3D-CT scanned data, and the <span class='snippet'>facial</span> muscles were placed between them just like as a real human face. With regard to the skin and muscle models, spring frames are used to simulate the elastic dynamics of a real <span class='snippet'>facial</span> skin and muscles. <span class='snippet'>Facial</span> modification can be flexibly realized by two factors: the expansion and contraction of non-linear springs which simulate a skin and muscles, and the motion of the <span class='snippet'>jaw</span> part of the skull. Using the system, one can represent realistic <span class='snippet'>facial</span> animation and predict <span class='snippet'>facial</span> modifications under given conditions for muscles and the skull. Furthermore, the method is effective for analyzing the relationship between modification on the <span class='snippet'>facial</span> surface and the motion of muscles and the skull},

The ossification centers later grow into the structures of the articular surface, major tubercle, and minor tubercle. There is a purported functional division between the articular surface and the tubercles, with the articular surface mainly responsible for the range of movement of the shoulder joint, and the tubercles bearing the insertions of the rotator cuff muscles, mainly devoted to securing the joint against humeral displacement. Using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics, we tested the presence of such developmental and functional divisions in the proximal humerus, applying the RV coefficient of Escoufier to these a priori hypothesized modules. Our results indicate that the proximal humerus might be a generally integrated structure. However, a weak signal for modular configuration was present, with slightly stronger support for the two modules depicting the boundaries between the purported functional regions of the epiphysis: the articular surface and the tubercles.},

  Abstract                 = {Variation in cranial robusticity among modern human populations is widely acknowledged but not well-understood. While the use of ldquorobustrdquo cranial traits in hominin systematics and phylogeny suggests that these characters are strongly heritable, this hypothesis has not been tested. Alternatively, cranial robusticity may be a response to differences in diet/mastication or it may be an adaptation to cold, harsh environments. This study quantifies the distribution of cranial robusticity in 14 geographically widespread human populations, and correlates this variation with climatic variables, neutral genetic distances, cranial size, and cranial shape. With the exception of the occipital torus region, all traits were positively correlated with each other, suggesting that they should not be treated as individual characters. While males are more robust than females within each of the populations, among the independent variables (cranial shape, size, climate, and neutral genetic distances), only shape is significantly correlated with inter-population differences in robusticity. Two-block partial least-squares analysis was used to explore the relationship between cranial shape (captured by three-dimensional landmark data) and robusticity across individuals. Weak support was found for the hypothesis that robusticity was related to mastication as the shape associated with greater robusticity was similar to that described for groups that ate harder-to-process diets. Specifically, crania with more prognathic faces, expanded glabellar and occipital regions, and (slightly) longer skulls were more robust than those with rounder vaults and more orthognathic faces. However, groups with more mechanically demanding diets (hunter-gatherers) were not always more robust than groups practicing some form of agriculture.

  Abstract                 = {Study of morphological form is fundamental to the discipline of paleoanthropology. The size and shape of our ancestors' anatomical features have long been the focus of research on hominin systematics, phylogeny, functional morphology, ontogeny, variation, and evolutionary change. Early physical anthropologists relied on both qualitative descriptions of anatomical shape and linear measurements to assess variation among hominins. The seminal works of W. W. Howells1 and C. E. Oxnard2 helped to bring multivariate techniques to the forefront of physical anthropology. Howells' intention was the objective delineation of components of shape, which could then fuel further analyses and interpretations, as well as clarification of the ways that growth influences interindividual and interpopulational differences in shape. He expressed concern that previous comparisons of individual measurements did not capture the overall shape of the skull, which is expressed by the relations between measurements.1:3 Similarly, Oxnard recognized that a multivariate approach to the study of complex shapes allows for such perturbations (e.g., variation and covariation)that are difficult to evaluate by eye and impossible to reveal by measurement and simple analysis alone.2:6 While multivariate methods offered clear advantages over univariate or bivariate representations of shape, the analysis of traditional morphometric measures such as linear distances, angles, and ratios, has limitations when it comes to quantifying the complex geometry of some anatomical structures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {For radiotherapy treatment planning of retinoblastoma in childhood, Computed Tomography (CT) represents the standard method for tumor volume delineation, despite some inherent limitations. CT scan is very useful in providing information on physical density for dose calculation and morphological volumetric information but presents a low sensitivity in assessing the tumor viability. On the other hand, 3D ultrasound (US) allows a high accurate definition of the tumor volume thanks to its high spatial resolution but it is not currently integrated in the treatment planning but used only for diagnosis and follow-up. Our ultimate goal is an automatic segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in the 3D US, the segmentation of the organs at risk (OAR) in the CT and the registration of both. In this paper, we present some preliminary results in this direction. We present 3D active contour-based segmentation of the eye ball and the lens in CT images; the presented approach incorporates the prior knowledge of the anatomy by using a 3D geometrical eye model. The automated segmentation results are validated by comparing with manual segmentations. Then, for the fusion of 3D CT and US images, we present two approaches: (i) landmark-based transformation, and (ii) object-based transformation that makes use of eye ball contour information on CT and US images.},

  Abstract                 = { A new method for robust generation of distance fields from triangle meshes is presented. Graphics hardware is used to accelerate a technique for generating layered depth images. From multiple layered depth images, a binary volume and a point representation are extracted. The point information is then used to convert the binary volume into a distance field. The method is robust and handles holes, spurious triangles and ambiguities. Moreover, the method lends itself to Boolean operations between solids. Since a point cloud as well as a signed distance is generated, it is possible to extract an iso-surface of the distance field and fit it to the point set. Using this method, one may recover sharp edge information. Examples are given where the method for generating distance fields coupled with mesh fitting is used to perform Boolean and morphological operations on triangle meshes.},

A 3-D image from a computer tomography (CT) scan of the skull was obtained, and a craniofacial superimposition was conducted to determine if the skull could belong to Miller. The superimposition method used in this case was to overlay the CT image of the skull onto Miller's postmortem photograph. In addition to the craniofacial superimposition, the images were juxtaposed to compare similarities or differences in facial morphology between the skull and photograph. Superimposition methods can be used to exclude identifications; however, they should not be used as a conclusive method for identification. In this case, there were sufficient similarities between the skull and Miller's photograph; therefore, the skull could not be eliminated as possibly being that of Miller.},

This interest is even more important when dealing with 3D images. The huge size of these datasets together with the complexity of the tasks where they are needed demand new approaches to the feature extraction problem. The need of an automatic procedure is specially important in many forensic applications, including the reconstruction of 3D models. In this work we propose a new method to automatically extract a set of relevant features from points clouds acquired by a 3D range scanner.

  Abstract                 = {Sexual dimorphism in the human craniofacial system is an important feature of intraspecific variation in recent and fossil humans. Although several studies have reported different morphological patterns of sexual dimorphism in different populations, this study searches for common morphological aspects related to functional anatomy of the respiratory apparatus. 3D geometric morphometrics were used to test the hypothesis that due to higher daily energy expenditure and associated greater respiratory air consumption as well as differences in body composition, males should have absolutely and relatively greater air passages in the bony cranial airways than females. We measured 25 3D landmarks in five populations (N = 212) of adult humans from different geographic regions. Male average cranial airways were larger in centroid sizes than female ones. Males tended to show relatively taller piriform apertures and, more consistently, relatively taller internal nasal cavities and choanae than females. Multivariate regressions and residual analysis further indicated that after standardizing to the same size, males still show relatively larger airway passages than females. Because the dimensions of the choanae are limiting factors for air transmission towards the noncranial part of the respiratory system, the identified sex-specific differences in cranial airways, possibly shared among human populations, may be linked with sex-specific differences in body size, composition, and energetics. These findings may be important to understanding trends in hominin facial evolution. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2011. {\^A}© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Facial heights, i.e. the vertical distances between the superior and inferior limits of facial compartments, contribute to the orientation of the viscerocranium in the primate skull. In humans, vertical facial variation is among the main sources of diversity and frequently associated with an integrated suite of other cranio-mandibular traits. Facial heights and kyphosis are also important factors in interspecific variation and models of hominoid evolution. The ontogenctic determination of adult facial orientation and its relation to phylogenetic variation are unclear, but crucial in all previously mentioned respects. We addressed these issues in a sample of 175 humans and chimpanzees with Procrustes based geometric morphometrics, testing hypotheses of interspecific similarity in postnatal ontogenetic trajectories, early versus later ontogenetic facial pattern determination, and a developmental model of morphological integration. We analyzed the contribution of postnatal morphogenesis to adult vertical facial variation by partitioning morphological variation into a portion of pure growth allometry and a non-allometric, fraction. A statistically significant difference of growth-allometries revealed that in both species growth established the adult skull proportions by vertical facial expansion, but while in chimpanzees the complete viscerocranium showed reorientation, in humans only the lower face was modified. In both species the results support a hypothesis of early facial pattern determination. A coincident emergence of morphological traits favors a hypothesis of developmental integration of the face, excluding traits of the basi- and neurocranium. Interspecific differences in integration may have implications for evolutionary studies. The present findings indicate that growth establishes the adult skull proportions and integrates principal facial orientation patterns, already there in early postnatal ontogeny.

  Abstract                 = {SummaryObjectives The significance of the cranial base in the contribution of normal and pathologic facial patterns is uncertain. The aim of this study was to explore and compare patterns of morphological covariation between the face and the lateral basicranium (anterior and middle cranial fossae) with covariation patterns between the face and the midline cranial base. Design We employed 2D geometric morphometrics and partial least squares analysis to quantify and compare correlation coefficient between principal variation patterns between basicranial and facial structures in lateral radiographs from 143 humans from Japan (N = 45), Europe (N = 65) and Africa (N = 34). Results In both comparisons basicranial patterns co-varied with dolichofacial and brachyfacial morphologies. The findings showed that the midline cranial base is not significantly correlated of common facial patterns (r = 0.37, P = 0.09). Instead, the lateral basicranium is significantly (P = 0.000), and significantly higher (r = 0.6) correlated with facial variation than is the midline cranial base. Conclusions The lateral basicranium may be of higher morphogenetic relevance for influencing facial variation than previously thought. This influence may be of clinical importance for the generation of skeletal class II or class III malocclusions. Further research should expand on geometric morphometric analysis of ontogenetic and clinical 3D data in order to advance in the understanding of these complex developmental relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {The cranial airways are in the center of the human face. Therefore variation in the size and shape of these central craniofacial structures could have important consequences for the surrounding midfacial morphology during development and evolution. Yet such interactions are unclear because one school of thought, based on experimental and developmental evidence, suggests a relative independence (modularity) of these two facial compartments, whereas another one assumes tight morphological integration. This study uses geometric morphometrics of modern humans and 40 three-dimensional-landmarks of the skeletal nasopharynx and nasal cavity and outer midfacial skeleton to analyze these questions in terms of modularity. The sizes of all facial compartments were all strongly correlated. Shape integration was high between the cranial airways and the outer midfacial skeleton and between the latter and the anterior airway openings (skeletal regions close to and including piriform aperture). However, no shape integration was detected between outer midface and posterior airway openings (nasopharynx and choanae). Similarly, no integration was detected between posterior and anterior airway openings. This may reflect functional modularization of nasal cavity compartments related to respiratory physiology and differential developmental interactions with the face. Airway size likely relates to the energetics of the organism, whereas airways shape might be more indicative of respiratory physiology and climate. Although this hypothesis should be addressed in future steps, here we suggest that selection on morphofunctional characteristics of the cranial airways could have cascading effects for the variation, development, and evolution of the human face.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract According to many investigations, changes in mandibular morphology can occur synchronously with changes in the environment, and sexual dimorphism of the mandible can be influenced by the environment. Sexual dimorphism during the last 1200 years was evaluated using geometric morphometric analysis of virtual cranial models. The method of geometric morphometrics allows differences in size and shape to be assessed separately. We analyzed groups of adult individuals dating to Early Middle Ages, High Middle Ages, Early Modern Ages and from a modern Czech population (21st century). Significant sexual dimorphism in mandibular size was found in all populations. A trend in the sexual dimorphism of size was seen, with differences between the sexes increasing gradually over time. Size changes in female mandibles were a better reflection of environmental conditions and climate than size changes in male mandibles. Regarding changes in the sexual dimorphism of shape, significant dimorphism was found in all four samples. However, the pattern of mandibular shape dimorphism was different and varied considerably between samples. There was only one stable shape trait showing sexual dimorphism across all four samples in our study: the gonion lies more laterally in male than in female mandibles and male mandibles are relatively wider than female mandibles. Sexual dimorphism of shape is not influenced by the climate; instead sexual selection might play a role. This research supports earlier studies that have found that the degree and pattern of sexual dimorphism is population-specific and the factors regulating sexual dimorphism today may not be the same as those in the past.},

  Abstract                 = {Bees and wasps could exhibit shape and size sexual dimorphism, and most of their morphological variation could depend on phenotypic responses due to environmental pressure during ontogenetic development. More complex measurement techniques related to size and shape rather than simply to mass and length should be required to analyze such a complex sexual dimorphism. In this study, differences related to wing shape and size of males and females of Ophion intricatus Brull{\'e} (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were evaluated using geometric morphometrics. Right and left wings of specimens were used, and a photographic matrix was constructed in which 18 morphological landmarks based on shape and vein patterns of the wings were digitalized. A multivariate analysis of wing shape showed significant differences between sexes and sites. The geometric variation demonstrated that the points at the intersection of radial and cubital-anal veins might be key characters to differentiate between sexes. This study also showed the presence of two clearly different male morphotypes coexisting in the same study site. However, it should be noted that the results of this study showed that the variation in wing shape is an analytical character in the determination of sexual differences in the family Ichneumonidae. These differences raise the question of whether sexual dimorphism of wing shape may be modulated by natural selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Deformable registration is prone to errors when it involves large and complex deformations, since the procedure can easily end up in a local minimum. To reduce the number of local minima, and thus the risk of misalignment, regularization terms based on prior knowledge can be incorporated in registration. We propose a regularization term that is based on statistical knowledge of the deformations that are to be expected. A statistical model, trained on the shapes of a set of segmentations, is integrated as a penalty term in a free-form registration framework. For the evaluation of our approach, we perform inter-patient registration of \{MR\} images, which were acquired for planning of radiation therapy of cervical cancer. The manual delineations of structures such as the bladder and the clinical target volume are available. For both structures, leave-one-patient-out registration experiments were performed. The propagated atlas segmentations were compared to the manual target segmentations by Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance. Compared with registration without the use of statistical knowledge, the segmentations were significantly improved, by 0.1 in Dice similarity and by 8&#xa0;mm Hausdorff distance on average for both structures. },

  Abstract                 = {Ontogenetic studies of African ape skulls lead to an analysis of morphological differences in terms of allometry, heterochrony, and sexual dimorphism. The use of geometric morphometrics allows us 1) to define size and shape variations as independent factors (an essential but seldom respected condition for heterochrony), and 2) to calculate in percentage of shape changes and to graphically represent the parts of shape variation which are related to various biological phenomena: common allometry, intraspecific allometry, and allometric and nonallometric shape discrimination. Three tridimensional Procrustes analyses and the calculation of multivariate allometries, discriminant functions, and statistical tests are used to compare the skulls of 50 Pan troglodytes, and 50 Gorilla gorilla of different dental stages. The results both complement and modify classical results obtained from similar material but with different methods. Size and Scaling in Primate Morphology, New York: Plenum, p. 175-205). As previously described by Shea, the common growth allometric pattern is very important (64\% of total shape variation). It corresponds to a larger increase of facial volume than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum, and a noticeable reshaping of the nuchal region (higher inion). However, the heterochronic interpretation based on common allometry is rather different from Shea. Gorillas differ from chimpanzees not only with a larger magnitude of allometric change (rate peramorphosis), as is classically said, but also grow more in size than in shape (size acceleration). In other words, for a similar stage of growth, gorillas have the size and shape corresponding to older chimpanzees, and for a similar shape, gorillas have a larger size than chimpanzees. In contrast, sexual dimorphism actually corresponds to allometric changes only, as classically demonstrated (time hypermorphosis). Sexual dimorphism is here significant in adult gorillas alone, and solely in terms of allometry (size-related shape and size, given that sagittal and nuchal crests are not taken into account). The study also permits us to differentiate two different shape variations that are classically confused in ontogenetic studies: a very small part of allometric shape change which is specific to each species (1\% of the total shape variation), and nonallometric species-specific traits independent of growth (8\% of total shape change). When calculated in terms of intraspecific allometries (including common allometry and noncommon allometry), shape changes are more extensive in gorillas (36\% of total shape change) than in chimpanzees (29\% of total shape change). The allometric differences mainly concern the inion, which becomes higher; the position of the foramen magnum, more dorsally oriented; and the palate, more tilted in adult gorillas than in adult chimpanzees. In contrast, nonallometric species-specific traits in gorillas are the long and flat vault characterized by a prominent occipital region, the higher and displaced backward glabella, and the protrusive nose. Biomechanical schemes built from shape partition suggest that the increased out-of-plumb position of the head during growth is partially compensated in gorillas by a powerful nuchal musculature due to the peculiar shape of the occipital region.},

  Abstract                 = {Human populations across the world vary greatly in cranial morphology. It is highly debated to what extent this variability has accumulated through neutral processes (genetic drift) or through natural selection driven by climate. By taking advantage of recent work showing that geographic distance along landmasses is an excellent proxy for neutral genetic differentiation, we quantify the relative role of drift versus selection in an exceptionally large dataset of human skulls. We show that neutral processes have been much more important than climate in shaping the human cranium. We further demonstrate that a large proportion of the signal for natural selection comes from populations from extremely cold regions. More generally, we show that, if drift is not explicitly accounted for, the effect of natural selection can be greatly overestimated. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {The socioeconomic structure of an early medieval society from the Mikulice settlement (Czech Republic) was studied on the basis of an evaluation of the fluctuating and directional asymmetry (DA) of skulls. Two distinct inhabited regions, castle and sub-castle, were compared. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was used as a bioindicator of environmental stress, which is thought to have been different in the Mikulice castle and sub-castle regions. DA is consistent with biomechanical loading, and it was expected to reflect different subsistence patterns. The material consisted of 129 crania from what was presumed to be a higher socioeconomic class (Mikulice castle) and 71 crania from middle and lower socioeconomic classes (Mikulice sub-castle). As a comparative sample, 138 crania from modern, lower socioeconomic classes (Pachner Collection) were used. The three-dimensional coordinates of 68 landmarks were digitized and analyzed using geometric morphometrics. In terms of DA, the highest values were recorded in the sub-castle sample and confirmed their lower socioeconomic position, with a grittier and lower protein diet compared with the castle sample. In terms of FA, distinctive differences between the sexes were found. In males, no differences were observed between castle and sub-castle, and the lowest FA values were recorded. In females, significantly higher values of FA were found, surprisingly in the castle sample, comparable with the more stressed Pachner Collection. We suspect that the FA reflects a more varied population of castle females as a consequence of patrilocality, although environmental stress remains a possibility.

For several years, modern paleontologists have used 3D computer graphics to help reconstruct these pieces of the past. Augmented reality (AR) leverages this technology to provide an interface that enhances the real world with synthetic supplements. Paleontologists can use AR to present virtual data directly within a real, 3D environment rather than on a flat monitor. This technology's immersiveness can give paleontologists new insights into their research and communicate the results to museum visitors in an exciting and effective way.},

  Abstract                 = {A total of 104 adult human crania (95 American Indian and 9 Labrador Eskimo) are used in this evaluation of a discriminant functional analysis for determining race and sex from eight cranial measurements. The methods used are those given by Giles and Elliot ('62). The study shows that non-deformed American Indian crania are racially misclassified as American White and Negro in 35.6% of the cases when using this metrical method. Deformed Indian crania are racially misclassified 60.0% and 4.4% of the time as White and Negro respectively. The determination of sex on male crania, regardless of deformation, is as accurate as, or better than, the visual method of identification. The female crania, however, are shown to be incorrectly sexed in nearly 50% of the cases, with one non-deformed group (Palus) running as high as 80.0%. This evaluation suggests, therefore, that discriminant functional analyses for race and / or sex determinations are not applicable to problems of human identification unless the crania are from that population on which these functions were established.},

  Abstract                 = {Archaic and modern human frontal bones are known to be quite distinct externally, by both conventional visual and metric evaluation. Internally this area of the skull has been considerably less well-studied. Here we present results from a comparison of interior, as well as exterior, frontal bone profiles from CT scans of five mid-Pleistocene and Neanderthal crania and 16 modern humans. Analysis was by a new morphometric method, Procrustes analysis of semi-landmarks, that permits the statistical comparison of curves between landmarks. As expected, we found substantial external differences between archaic and modern samples, differences that are mainly confined to the region around the brow ridge. However, in the inner median-sagittal profile, the shape remained remarkably stable over all 21 specimens. This implies that no significant alteration in this region has taken place over a period of a half-million years or more of evolution, even as considerable external change occurred within the hominid clade spanning several species. This confirms that the forms of the inner and outer aspects of the human frontal bone are determined by entirely independent factors, and further indicates unexpected stability in anterior brain morphology over the period during which modern human cognitive capacities emerged.

  Abstract                 = {Before one can study evolutionary rates one must reject the null model of symmetric random walk. for which the requisite quantity does not exist. As random walks reliably simulate all the features we find so compelling in the fossil record-jumps, trends, and irregular cycles-rejection of this irritating hypothesis is much more difficult than one might hope. This paper reviews principal theorems from the mathematical literature of random walk and shows how they may be applied to empirical data by scaling net changes according to the square root of elapsed time. The notorious pair of "opposite" findings, equilibrium and anagenesis, may be construed as deviations from random walk in opposite directions. Malmgren's data on Globorotalia tumida, previously interpreted as an example of punctuated anagenesis, are consistent with a random walk showing neither punctuation nor anagenesis, but instead varying in speed over four subsequences.},

In studies of mean differences between groups, the statistical analysis of these finite elements is equivalent to competent statistical analysis of the same data using any other geometric metaphor, such as properly standardized vector descriptions of landmark "movement" or scalar measures, size and shape variables, taken in sufficient variety. In applications to landmark data, the reality of finite-element depictions is purely statistical rather than phenomenological. In the absence of additional evidence, they should not be held either more or less biologically meaningful than other descriptions of the same landmark changes to which they lead. These propositions are exemplified using landmark data from 13 cases of Apert syndrome.},

  Abstract                 = {At the core of contemporary morphometrics--the quantitative study of biological shape variation--is a synthesis of two originally divergent methodological styles. One contributory tradition is the multivariate analysis of covariance matrices originally developed as biometrics and now dominant across a broad expanse of applied statistics. This approach, couched solely in the linear geometry of covariance structures, ignores biomathematical aspects of the original measurements. The other tributary emphasizes the direct visualization of changes in biological form. However, making objective the biological meaning of the features seen in those diagrams was always problematical; also, the representation of variation, as distinct from pairwise difference, proved infeasible. To combine these two variants of biomathematical modeling into a valid praxis for quantitative studies of biological shape was a goal earnestly sought though most of this century. That goal was finally achieved in the 1980s when techniques from mathematical statistics, multivariate biometrics, non-Euclidean geometry and computer graphics were combined in a coherent new system of tools for the complete regionalized quantitative analysis of landmark points together with the biomedical images in which they are seen. In this morphometric synthesis, correspondence of landmarks (biologically labeled geometric points, like "bridge of the nose") across specimens is taken as a biomathematical primitive. The shapes of configurations of landmarks are defined as equivalence classes with respect to the Euclidean similarity group and then represented as single points in David Kendall's shape space, a Riemannian manifold with Procrustes distance as metric. All conventional multivariate strategies carry over to the study of shape variation and covariation when shapes are interpreted in the tangent space to the shape manifold at an average shape. For biomathematical interpretation of such analyses, one needs a basis for the tangent space compatible with the reality of local biotheoretical processes and explanations at many different geometric scales, and one needs graphics for visualizing average shape differences and other statistical contrasts there. Both of these needs are managed by the thin-plate spline, a deformation function that has an unusually helpful linear algebra. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks to deformation analysis of the images from which the landmarks originally arose. This article reviews the history and principal tools of this synthesis in their biomathematical and biometrical context and demonstrates their usefulness in a study of focal neuroanatomical anomalies in schizophrenia.},

  Abstract                 = {In many current medical applications of image analysis, objects are detected and delimited by boundary curves or surfaces. Yet the most effective multivariate statistics available pertain to labeled points (landmarks) only. In the finite-dimensional feature space that landmarks support, each case of a data set is equivalent to a deformation map deriving it from the average form. This paper introduces a new extension of the finite-dimensional spline-based approach for incorporating edge information. In this implementation edgels are restricted to landmark loci: they are interpreted as pairs of landmarks at infinitesimal separation in a specific direction. The effect of changing edge direction is a singular perturbation of the thin-plate spline for the landmarks alone. An appropriate normalization yields a basis for image deformations corresponding to changes of edge direction without landmark movement; this basis complements the basis of landmark deformations ignoring edge information. We derive explicit formulas for these edge warps, evaluate the quadratic form expressing bending energies of their formal combinations, and show the resulting spectrum of edge features in typical scenes. These expressions will aid all investigations into medical images that entail comparisons of anatomical scene analyses to a normative or typical form.},

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 subadult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H. sapiens, who were imaged by \{MR\} instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial length to height ratio not reducible to either process. Our methodology allows a separation of these independent processes (and their impact on cranial shape) that conventional methods have not found. },

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample.

  Abstract                 = {Anthropometry of the face has always been an interesting subject for artists and plastic surgeons. Since ancient times, many rules have been proposed for the ideal face. The authors measured directly vertical and horizontal proportions of the face and inclinations of the soft-tissue facial profile in 1050 young Turkish adults. Differences between the facial measurements of subjects from seven different geographic regions were analyzed. Some of the measurements were compared further with the measurements of other populations in the literature, and the validity of the neoclassical canons were tested. The special head height measure was shorter than the special face height in the majority of our study group (women/men: equal height, 13%/15%; longer special head height, 28%/30%; shorter special head height, 59%/55%). Faces with three equally high-profile sections were not seen in women or in men. When the forehead height was compared with the nose height, equality was present in a small percentage of the population (women/men: equal height, 17%/18%; longer forehead, 41%/42%; shorter forehead, 42%/40%). The nose height was equal to the lower face height in a minority of the population (women/men: equal height, 10%/11%; longer nose, 9%/11%; shorter nose (81%/78%). The forehead height was shorter than the lower face height in the majority of the population (women/men: equal height, 8%/9%; longer forehead, 12%/13%; shorter forehead, 79%/78%). The intercanthal distance was shorter than the nose width in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width, 20%/19%; wider intercanthal distance, 35%/37%; narrower intercanthal width, 65%/68%). The population was distributed evenly in regard to the variations of the orbital proportion canon (women/men: equal intercanthal width and eye fissure length, 31%/36%; wider intercanthal distance, 34%/27%; narrower intercanthal width, 35%/37%). The mouth width was greater than 1.5 times the nose width in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width, 6%/5%; wider mouth, 53%/54%; narrower mouth, 41%/41%). The nose width was narrower than one quarter of the face width in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width, 4%/3%; wider nose, 30%/39%; narrower nose, 66%/58%). The nose inclination was equal to the ear inclination in a very small fraction of subjects (women/men: equal inclination, 3%/3%; greater nose inclination, 88%/87%; less nose inclination, 9%/9%). To sketch an outline of the average facial profile in the population studied, a convex facial profile is revealed, with the forehead and the chin retrodisplaced minimally with respect to the midface. The neoclassical canons were found to be invalid for the majority of the population in this study, and different proportional analytic results were obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {The extent to which faces depicted as surfaces devoid of pigmentation and with minimal texture cues ('head models') could be matched with photographs (when unfamiliar) and identified (when familiar) was examined in three experiments. The head models were obtained by scanning the three-dimensional surface of the face with a laser, and by displaying the surface measured in this way by using standard computer-aided design techniques. Performance in all tasks was above chance but far from ceiling. Experiment 1 showed that matching of unfamiliar head models with photographs was affected by the resolution with which the surface was displayed, suggesting that subjects based their decisions, at least in part, on three-dimensional surface structure. Matching accuracy was also affected by other factors to do with the view points shown in the head models and test photographs, and the type of lighting used to portray the head model. In experiment 2 further evidence for the importance of the nature of the illumination used was obtained, and it was found that the addition of a hairstyle (not that of the target face) did not facilitate matching. In experiment 3 identification of the head models by colleagues of the people shown was compared with identification of photographs where the hair was concealed and eyes were closed. Head models were identified less well than these photographs, suggesting that the difficulties in their recognition are not solely due to the lack of hair. Women's heads were disproportionately difficult to recognise from the head models. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the use of such three-dimensional head models in forensic and surgical applications.},

The covariation of multiple traits is investigated to study the evolutionary changes of the underlying anatomical models, mostly through the introduction of digital biomedical imaging procedures and of computed geometrical analyses supported by multivariate statistics. Functional craniology  The evolution of the human cranium is consequently considered in terms of functional and structural relationships between its components, largely influenced by the allometric variations associated with the increase in the relative cranial capacity. In the human genus, the changes in the face, base, and neurocranium are characterised by a mosaic variation, in which adaptations, secondary consequences, and stochastic factors concur to generate a set of anatomical possibilities and constraints. Systemic perspectives to the evolution of the human cranial morphology  Concepts like morphological modularity, anatomical integration, and heterochrony represent key issues in the development of the current human evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Anatomical systems are organized through a network of structural and functional relationships among their elements. This network of relationships is the result of evolution, it represents the actual target of selection, and it generates the set of rules orienting and constraining the morphogenetic processes. Understanding the relationship among cranial and cerebral components is necessary to investigate the factors that have influenced and characterized our neuroanatomy, and possible drawbacks associated with the evolution of large brains. The study of the spatial relationships between skull and brain in the human genus has direct relevance in cranial surgery. Geometrical modeling can provide functional perspectives in evolution and brain physiology, like in simulations to investigate metabolic heat production and dissipation in the endocranial form. Analysis of the evolutionary constraints between facial and neural blocks can provide new information on visual impairment. The study of brain form variation in fossil humans can supply a different perspective for interpreting the processes behind neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Following these examples, it is apparent that paleontology and biomedicine can exchange relevant information and contribute at the same time to the development of robust evolutionary hypotheses on brain evolution, while offering more comprehensive biological perspectives with regard to the interpretation of pathological processes.},

  Abstract                 = {When analysing the performance of orthopaedic implants the vast majority of computational studies use either a single or limited number of bone models. The results are then extrapolated to the population as a whole, overlooking the inherent and large interpatient variability in bone quality and geometry. This paper describes the creation of a three dimensional, statistical, finite element analysis (FEA) ready model of the femur using principal component analysis. To achieve this a registration scheme based on elastic surface matching and a mesh morphing algorithm has been developed. This method is fully automated enabling registration and generation of high resolution models. The variation in both geometry and material properties was extracted from 46 computer tomography scans and captured by the statistical model. Analysis of mesh quality showed this was maintained throughout the model generation and sampling process. Reconstruction of the training femurs showed 35 eigenmodes were required for accurate reproduction. A set of unique, anatomically realistic femur models were generated using the statistical model, with a variation comparable to that seen in the population. This study illustrates a methodology with the potential to generate femur models incorporating material properties for large scale multi-femur finite element studies.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive knowledge of orbital and periorbital anatomy is necessary to understand disorders in these regions and to apply medical and surgical management appropriately and safely. The configuration of the bony orbit resembles a four-sided pyramid that becomes three-sided near the apex, with a volume of approximately 30 cm(3). The adult orbital rim measures, on average, 40 mm horizontally and 35 mm vertically, with the widest dimension of the orbit 1 cm behind the anterior orbital rim. The medial walls are roughly parallel and are 25 rum apart in adults. The length of the medial orbital wall from the anterior lacrimal crest is 45 to 50 mm, whereas the lateral wall from the rim to the superior orbital fissure measures 40 mm [1,2]. The lateral orbital walls are angled 90 degrees from each other. The lateral orbital rim is approximately at the level of the equator of the globe. The globe has an average volume of 6.5 cm(3) and has a shape formed by two spheres, the cornea and the sclera, with radius of curvatures equal to 8 and 12 mm, respectively [2]. Globes in the average adult and newborn infant measure 24 mm and 16.4 mm, respectively, in the anteroposterior dimension.},

With age, or because of genetic disposition, the eyeball descends, reducing the space between it and the floor of the orbit. This will inevitably cause forward projection of the extraconical orbital fat, creating herniated fat pads and resulting in enophthalmia. Based on the volume of the bony orbit and its contents, it is likely that relocating, rather then removing, herniated fat pads will greatly improve and prevent the enophthalmia of aging and give the globe a position and a projection of youth. Based on the results of surgery using the capsulopalpebral flap, it is likely that a descended Lockwood suspensory ligament, rather than a weakened orbital septum, is the cause of herniated fat pads and enophthalmia. We feel neither a weakened orbital septum nor an overabundance of orbital fat nor a shallow orbit is responsible for either of these conditions. We give a detailed description of]low to raise the globe, preserve and relocate herniated fat pads, and manage and prevent enophthalmia and obtain a beautiful, youthful looking eye.},

Es handelte sich hierbei um etwa 5000 Kinder von schwarzen amerikanischen Soldaten und wei{\ss}en deutschen M{\"u}ttern, die nach 1945 geboren wurden. Im Verlauf der f{\"u}nfziger Jahre wurden diese Kinder Gegenstand wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen aus den Bereichen der Sozialanthropologie und der Sozialpsychologie. Im Mittelpunkt stand die Auseinandersetzung mit den Konzeptionen von Rasse und Andersartigkeit als Definitionskriterien dieser neuen gesellschaftlichen Gruppe. Je zwei anthropologische und sozialpsychologische Studien aus der Zeit zwischen 1952 und 1960 werden aus psychologiegeschichtlicher Perspektive hinsichtlich ihrer Fragestellung und Methodik untersucht. Hierbei wird deutlich, dass sich die deutsche Nachkriegsanthropologie fast ausschlie{\ss}lich auf das biologistische Gesellschaftsmodell der Vorkriegszeit bezieht. Die sozialp{\"a}dagogisch-sozialpsychologischen Studien zeigen hingegen einen variablen gedanklichen Ansatz und thematisieren teils die Kinder, teils die Gesellschaft, in der sie leben, als das Kernproblem ihrer sozialen Stellung. Die kritische Auseinandersetzung in diesen Studien wird in ihren historischen Kontext eingebettet, der in den anthropologischen Studien zur sogenannten Rassemischung von 1900 bis 1940 und in der breitangelegten internationalen Kampagne der UNESCO zu Beginn der f{\"u}nfziger Jahre zur Neudefinition der Kategorie "Rasse" als Reaktion auf die nationalsozialistische Rassenpolitik seinen sinnf{\"a}lligsten Ausdruck fand.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the "renaissance" of biogeography in the last two decades with its central role in the study of biodiversity and evolution, and the "revolution" in morphometrics brought about by methods based on the analysis of Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks, the use of geometric morphometrics in biogeographic studies has been rather limited. With this analysis we aim to provide an example of how geometric morphometrics can fruitfully be applied to the study of clinal variation in a widespread African monkey group by a simple extension of methods widely employed by macroecologists and biogeographers to multivariate shape data. Throughout the paper we aim to explain these techniques so that those who are new to them can use and adapt them for their own needs, in some cases providing specific instructions on how to perform certain operations in standard morphometrics and statistical software. Our hope is that this may stimulate morphometricians and scientists from other disciplines to explore geographic variation in size and shape using up-to-date geometric morphometric methods. The application of geometric morphometrics to ecological, biogeographic and phylogeographic studies has enormous potential for a thorough understanding of how form changes in space and time during evolution and in relation to genetic and environmental factors.},

Craniofacial dimensions and indices determined by Woo and Morant (1934) on a world sample of 55 skeletal populations were used as dependent variables. Sample sizes were as low as 39 in some calculations because either skeletal or geographic data were missing. Thirteen climatically related averaged variables, for each population's provenience, were the independent variables. Multivariate techniques of bivariate correlation, multiple regression, and partial correlation were applied. A strong, statistically significant cline of increasing nose protrusion, with decreasing absolute humidity and with increasing latitude, was found. Cold climatic variables appeared to be of greater importance than warm measures. Similarly, absolute humidity was found to be a much better predictor of nose protrusion than was relative humidity.},

  Abstract                 = {The present brief review is a survey of the role of forensic anthropology (FA) in the new millennium. After an introduction which deals with the expanding definition of the discipline and the issue of professionality and training, the author approaches the role and novel developments of the field, with particular reference to the past 5 years. Such developments are discussed in a sectorial manner, distinguishing the role of research in the areas of forensic anthropology which deal with human remains and those that deal with the living. As regards the "human remains" domain, advances and stalls still present in the fields of species and postmortem interval determination, sexing, aging and attribution of ancestry are stressed. The need for standards in facial reconstruction and positive identification by bone morphology are underlined, as well as the growing role of the anthropologist in detecting signs of trauma. Finally, the relatively new role of the forensic anthropologist in the domain of identification of the living is described, although this area is still underrepresented as regards research activity: these studies concern the strive to devise methods for identifying faces (e.g. in the case of crimes registered by videosurveillance systems), aging living individuals or juveniles represented in pedopornographic material.},

Summary statistics are reported for a sample of 67 individuals of normal weight (as determined by a body mass index (BMI) of 19-25). Statistical analyses were used to assess relationships between tissue thickness, age, and BMI. Results indicate that no significant relationship exists between tissue thickness and age for males, and for only 3/19 points in females. Also, only four points showed significant relationships between tissue thickness and sex. However, significant relationships exist between BMI and tissue thickness at multiple points for both males and females. Compared to other American and Asian populations in the literature, Chinese-Americans generally had thinner facial tissue; though, this difference was not assessed statistically. Finally, data generated in this study will add to the body of knowledge concerning facial tissue depth variation in modern humans.},

Forty young adult males having mandibular prognathism were compared with 40 having normal occlusion. This was conducted to carry out geometric morphometric assessments to localize alterations, using Procrustes analysis and thin-plate spline analysis, in addition to conventional cephalometric techniques. Procrustes analysis indicated that the mean craniofacial, midfacial and mandibular morphology was significantly different in prognathic subjects compared with normal controls. This finding was corroborated by the multivariate Hotelling T-2-test of cephalometric variables. Mandibular prognathism demonstrated a shorter and slightly retropositioned maxilla, a greater total length and anterior positioning of the mandible. Thin-plate spline analysis revealed a developmental diminution of the palatomaxillary region anteroposteriorly and a developmental elongation of the mandible anteroposteriorly, leading to the appearance of a prognathic mandibular profile. In conclusion, thin-plate spline analysis seems to provide a valuable supplement for conventional cephalometric analysis because the complex patterns of craniofacial shape change are visualized suggestive by means of grid deformations.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to acquire accurate data of craniofacial soft tissue thickness (CFSTT) and nasal profile in Chinese people of Han population. A total of 31 anatomical landmarks and 4 nasal profile parameters were determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 425 subjects (233 males and 192 females). In the present study, the mean CFSTT values of male subjects exceeded those of female subjects at most anatomical landmarks except at seven (22.58%) and 6 out of the 7 landmarks were bilateral anatomical landmark points. The age-related and sex age interactions were found to be statistically significant at all landmarks. Significant differences were found in the nasal profile data of males and females, and 15 out of 20 different groups had significant differences between sexes, and the mean values of nasal length, nasal height, nasal depth and nasal breadth in males were all greater than those in females. Furthermore, both CFSTT and nasal profile showed good correlation with age. The thickest CFSTT of male and female were found at the respective ages of 45-59 and 35-44, and the nasal profile becomes more constant after 24 years of age. CFSTT of the lower part of the face shows greater variation compared to the upper part, so special care needs to be applied when reconstructing the lower portion of the face. Our data on CFSTT and nasal profile for the Chinese Xi'an Han population is important in understanding craniofacial characteristics of the Chinese population and might be potentially helpful in forensic identification.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: To describe the metric measurements and normal anatomic variants in Chinese bony orbits. Methods: Orbital osteology was studied in 194 orbits from 97 Chinese skulls. Morphologic observations and metric measurements were made to elucidate the variations of the orbital bony anatomy and to localize important fissures and foramina within the orbit. Sexual dimorphism and side asymmetry of orbital features were analyzed. Results were then compared with data from other populations. Results: The details of the orbital osteology in Chinese are described. Most orbital features show anatomic variations in terms of their existence, quantity, and location. Anatomic variants including quadruple and extrasutural posterior ethmoidal foramen are described for the first time. Side asymmetry and sexual dimorphism (male, larger than female) are demonstrated in some orbital features. Compared with white and American populations, orbital measurements are generally smaller in Chinese, probably related to their smaller orbital size. Conclusions: The Chinese orbital osteology demonstrates considerable variability. The newly described anatomic variants found on the posterior ethmoidal foramen may affect surgical procedures related to the medial orbital wall. Sexual dimorphism and ethnic variations of the orbital bony anatomy may affect surgical approach to orbital diseases in different populations.},

Forty young M. mulatta were surgically produced in 20 animals, and the small maxillary segments moved medialward. Intrapair observation tests were applied to selected measurements and indices of symmetry relationships. Deformity of the surgically undisturbed nasal septum occurred in response to the maxillary deformation. The lateral walls were moved medially with the maxilla, but in six months symmetry relationships were similar to those found in the control animals. The lateral walls of the nasal cavity appeared to be relatively independent of the shape and position of the tooth carrying part of the maxilla. The development and use of primate models can contribute to understanding the extent of the adaptational response systems in facial morphogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Proper delineation of ocular anatomy in 3-dimensional (3D) imaging is a big challenge, particularly when developing treatment plans for ocular diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presently used in clinical practice for diagnosis confirmation and treatment planning for treatment of retinoblastoma in infants, where it serves as a source of information, complementary to the fundus or ultrasonographic imaging. Here we present a framework to fully automatically segment the eye anatomy for \{MRI\} based on 3D active shape models (ASM), and we validate the results and present a proof of concept to automatically segment pathological eyes. Methods and Materials Manual and automatic segmentation were performed in 24 images of healthy children's eyes (3.29 ± 2.15 years of age). Imaging was performed using a 3-T \{MRI\} scanner. The \{ASM\} consists of the lens, the vitreous humor, the sclera, and the cornea. The model was fitted by first automatically detecting the position of the eye center, the lens, and the optic nerve, and then aligning the model and fitting it to the patient. We validated our segmentation method by using a leave-one-out cross-validation. The segmentation results were evaluated by measuring the overlap, using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the mean distance error. Results We obtained a \{DSC\} of 94.90 ± 2.12% for the sclera and the cornea, 94.72 ± 1.89% for the vitreous humor, and 85.16 ± 4.91% for the lens. The mean distance error was 0.26 ± 0.09 mm. The entire process took 14 seconds on average per eye. Conclusion We provide a reliable and accurate tool that enables clinicians to automatically segment the sclera, the cornea, the vitreous humor, and the lens, using MRI. We additionally present a proof of concept for fully automatically segmenting eye pathology. This tool reduces the time needed for eye shape delineation and thus can help clinicians when planning eye treatment and confirming the extent of the tumor. },

  Abstract                 = {Forensic facial reconstruction aims at estimating the facial outlook associated with an unidentified skull specimen. Estimation is generally based on tabulated average values of soft tissue thicknesses measured at a sparse set of landmarks on the skull. Traditional [`]plastic' methods apply modeling clay or plasticine on a cast of the skull, approximating the estimated tissue depths at the landmarks and interpolating in between. Current computerized techniques mimic this landmark interpolation procedure using a single static facial surface template. However, the resulting reconstruction is biased by the specific choice of the template and no face-specific regularization is used during the interpolation process. We reduce the template bias by using a flexible statistical model of a dense set of facial surface points, combined with an associated sparse set of skull-based landmarks. This statistical model is constructed from a facial database of (N = 118) individuals and limits the reconstructions to statistically plausible outlooks. The actual reconstruction is obtained by fitting the skull-based landmarks of the template model to the corresponding landmarks indicated on a digital copy of the skull to be reconstructed. The fitting process changes the face-specific statistical model parameters in a regularized way and interpolates the remaining landmark fit error using a minimal bending thin-plate spline (TPS)-based deformation. Furthermore, estimated properties of the skull specimen (BMI, age and gender, e.g.) can be incorporated as conditions on the reconstruction by removing property-related shape variation from the statistical model description before the fitting process. The proposed statistical method is validated, both in terms of accuracy and identification success rate, based on leave-one-out cross-validation tests applied on the facial database. Accuracy results are obtained by statistically analyzing the local 3D facial surface differences of the reconstructions and their corresponding ground truth. Identification success rate is obtained by comparing, based on correlation, Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) signatures of the reconstructed and the original 3D facial surfaces in the database. A subjective identification success rate is quantified based on face-pool tests. Finally a qualitative comparison is made between facial reconstructions of a real-case skull, based on two typical static face models and our statistical model, showing the shortcomings of current face models and the improved performance of the statistical model.},

  Abstract                 = {When confronted with a corpse that is unrecognizable due to its state of decomposition, soft-tissue mutilation or incineration, and if no other identification evidence is available, craniofacial reconstruction (CFR) can be a useful tool in the identification of the body. Traditional methods are based on manual reconstruction by physically modelling a face on a skull replica with clay or plasticine. The progress in computer science and the improvement of medical imaging technologies during recent years has had a significant impact on this domain. New, fast, flexible and computer-based objective reconstruction programs are under development. Employing the newer technologies and permanently evaluating the obtained results will hopefully lead to more accurate reconstructions, beneficial to the added value of CFR methods during crime-scene investigations. A general model-based workflow is observed, when analysing computerized CFR techniques today. The main purpose of this paper is to give an overview of existing computer-based CFR methods up to date defined within a common framework using a general taxonomy. The paper will also discuss the various alternatives and problems which arise during the process of designing a CFR program.},

  Abstract                 = {Forensic craniofacial reconstruction (CFR) aims at estimating the facial outlook associated to an unknown skull for victim identification. Computerized CFR techniques are essentially a virtual mimicking of manual CFR techniques and all share the same conceptual model-based framework. We propose a fully automated Bayesian based statistical framework estimating the most probable face, according to a known craniofacial model (CFM), given the, possibly inaccurate, skull data. A multivariate Gaussian distribution is assumed for the shape parameters of the CFM, only allowing face-like solutions. The CFM is improved by encoding tissue depth differently as an extra value for 52 landmarks on the face and by incorporating gray-valued texture information. A fully automated and consistent technique is obtained by the use of an implicit target skull representation (TSR). The most plausible face associated to the target skull is calculated using an expectation-maximization procedure that is robust to small (noise) and/or gross errors (outliers). A clinical database of 12 individuals is used for simulating realistic reconstruction scenarios. Validation is performed in terms of reconstruction accuracy and recognition success. Within the same EM reconstruction framework, the proposed procedure is compared to alternative reconstructions using different target skull representations and different CFMs incorporating various amounts of covariance. The results indicate that the proposed CFM performs better than the other models. Furthermore, the use of the implicit TSR generates more consistent and better results compared to a realistic landmark based skull representation. Finally, these results also confirm that the Bayesian framework formulation is indeed robust against noise and outliers in the skull data.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate measurement of facial sexual dimorphism is useful to understanding facial anatomy and specifically how faces influence, and have been influenced by, sexual selection. An important facial aspect is the display of bilateral symmetry, invoking the need to investigate aspects of symmetry and asymmetry separately when examining facial shape. Previous studies typically employed landmarks that provided only a sparse facial representation, where different landmark choices could lead to contrasting outcomes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism is only tested as a difference of sample means, which is statistically the same as a difference in population location only. Within the framework of geometric morphometrics, we partition facial shape, represented in a spatially dense way, into patterns of symmetry and asymmetry, following a two-factor anova design. Subsequently, we investigate sexual dimorphism in symmetry and asymmetry patterns separately, and on multiple aspects, by examining (i) population location differences as well as differences in population variance-covariance; (ii) scale; and (iii) orientation. One important challenge in this approach is the proportionally high number of variables to observations necessitating the implementation of permutational and computationally feasible statistics. In a sample of gender-matched young adults (18-25 years) with self-reported European ancestry, we found greater variation in male faces than in women for all measurements. Statistically significant sexual dimorphism was found for the aspect of location in both symmetry and asymmetry (directional asymmetry), for the aspect of scale only in asymmetry (magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry) and, in contrast, for the aspect of orientation only in symmetry. Interesting interplays with hypotheses in evolutionary and developmental biology were observed, such as the selective nature of the force underpinning sexual dimorphism and the genetic independence of the structural patterns of fluctuating asymmetry. Additionally, insights into growth patterns of the soft tissue envelope of the face and underlying skull structure can also be obtained from the results.},

  Abstract                 = {Mild facial asymmetries are common in typical growth patterns. Therefore, detection of disordered facial growth patterns in individuals characterized by asymmetries is preferably accomplished by reference to the typical variation found in the general population rather than to some ideal of perfect symmetry, which rarely exists. This presents a challenge in developing an asymmetry assessment tool that is applicable, without modification, to detect both mild and severe facial asymmetries. In this paper we use concepts from geometric morphometrics to obtain robust and spatially-dense asymmetry assessments using a superimposition protocol for comparison of a face with its mirror image. Spatially-dense localization of asymmetries was achieved using an anthropometric mask consisting of uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks that were automatically indicated on 3D facial images. Robustness, in the sense of an unbiased analysis under increasing asymmetry, was ensured by an adaptive, robust, least-squares superimposition. The degree of overall asymmetry in an individual was scored using a root-mean-squared-error, and the proportion was scored using a novel relative significant asymmetry percentage. This protocol was applied to a database of 3D facial images from 359 young healthy individuals and three individuals with disordered facial growth. Typical asymmetry statistics were derived and were mainly located on, but not limited to, the lower two-thirds of the face in males and females. The asymmetry in males was more extensive and of a greater magnitude than in females. This protocol and proposed scoring of asymmetry with accompanying reference statistics will be useful for the detection and quantification of facial asymmetry in future studies.},

There is concern that normative data on PFs now available may not reflect all racial/ethnic groups and might be inaccurate in general. Objectives To accomplish a large population based study that would accurately determine normative PF values across the full diversity of the Canadian school age population. Methods A normative sample of school age children was identified in Vancouver, British Columbia and Winnipeg, Manitoba to reflect the diversity of racial and national groups in Canada. The sample included students in grades 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 from 17 schools in Vancouver and 31 schools in Winnipeg. Schools were selected based on racial diversity obtained from data from the 2001 Statistics Canada census. 1064 students in Vancouver and 1033 students in Winnipeg were photographed in a standardized way. Photographs were analyzed using a computerized method. Results Analysis demonstrated that PFs do grow with age and there is a slight but meaningful difference between boys and girls in each age group. It is possible to define Canadian standards without reference to racial or ethnic origin. Conclusion Mean results with norms and standard deviations are presented in figures for clinical use and are clinically smaller than those found in the most commonly used reference book.},

  Abstract                 = {The study's aim was to identify female and male face shape variability in order to establish typical profiles for the design of masks. A specific data acquisition photogrammetric station was used for this purpose. A preliminary survey using anthropometric techniques was conducted on 301 females and 208 males, randomly selected from the French military population, in order to constitute two samples of 30 males and 30 females for the stereometric survey. For each subject, the stereorestitution of face photos was made on three sets of data: (1) 37 anatomical landmarks previously identified by a black point marked on the face; (2) 7 anatomical arcs, also drawn with a black pencil; and (3) 1500 - 2000 points distributed on horizontal cross-sections at different vertical levels. <br /><br />The analysis only concerned the global face shape, and excluded the central area (eyes, nose and mouth). A common origin and reference axis system was defined. All the three-dimensional (3D) produced data was processed using computer-aided design software, after some adaptations. Subjects were selected iteratively for five levels of cross-section and three anatomical arcs so as to characterize least variation amplitudes, subject by subject. Five groups were identified. All cross-sections were verified to check the validity of the preceding step. By this method, each group was defined by a mean profile form and by the amplitude of this form for each point of the profile. Males and females were present in each group, and for each group, a greater variability was noted at the lower part of the face. This variability can be explained as the result of morphological and functional phenomena. <br /><br />These results can be applied to the design of new protective equipment for the fore-face indeed they were used for the design of a new mask for the French military.},

Some examples include phenotypic changes due to phenotypic plasticity between two environments, changes due to predator/non-predator character shifts, character displacement via competitive interactions, and patterns of sexual dimorphism. However, methods for analyzing phenotypic change for multivariate data have not been rigorously developed. Here we outline a method for testing vectors of phenotypic change in terms of two important attributes: the magnitude of change (vector length) and the direction of change described by trait covariation (angular difference between vectors). We describe a permutation procedure for testing these attributes, which allows non-targeted sources of variation to be held constant. We provide examples that illustrate the importance of considering vector attributes of phenotypic change in biological studies, and we demonstrate how greater inference can be made than by evaluating variance components with MANOVA alone. Finally, we consider how our method may be extended to more complex data.},

  Abstract                 = {The ultimate goal of machine vision is image understanding - the ability not only to recover image structure but also to know what it represents. By definition, this involves the use of models which describe and label the expected structure of the world. Over the past decade, model-based vision has been applied successfully to images of man-made objects. It has proved much more difficult to develop model-based approaches to the interpretation of images of complex and variable structures such as faces or the internal organs of the human body (as visualised in medical images). In such cases it has even been problematic to recover image structure reliably, without a model to organise the often noisy and incomplete image evidence. The key problem is that of variability. To be useful, a model needs to be specific - that is, to be capable of representing only 'legal' examples of the modelled object(s). It has proved difficult to achieve this whilst allowing for natural variability. Recent developments have overcome this problem; it has been shown that specific patterns of variability inshape and grey-level appearance can be captured by statistical models that can be used directly in image interpretation.This document describes methods of building models of shape and appearance, and how such models can be used to interpret images.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The present study investigates whether the human mandible is sexually dimorphic during early postnatal development and whether early dimorphic features persist during subsequent ontogeny. We also examine whether mandibular dimorphism is linked to dimorphism of dental development. Dense CT-derived mandibular meshes of 84 females and 75 males, ranging from birth to adulthood, were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. On the basis of the specimen's chronological ages and mineralization stages of the deciduous and permanent teeth, we compute dental age as proxy for dental development by the additive conjoint measurement method. By birth, males have, on average, more advanced age-specific shapes than females. However, sex differences decrease quickly as females catch up via a different association between shape and size. This leads to an almost complete reduction of sexual dimorphism between the ages of 4 and 14. From puberty to adulthood, males are characterized by allometric shape changes while the shape of the female mandible continues to change even after size has ceased to increase. Dimorphism of dental maturation becomes visible only at puberty. Sexual dimorphism, concentrated at the ramus and the mental region during the earliest ontogenetic stages and again at adulthood, is not associated with the development of the teeth. At puberty there is a simultaneous peak in size increase, shape development, and dental maturation likely controlled by the surge of sex hormones with a dimorphic onset age. We argue that the infant and adult dimorphism of the mental region may be associated with the development of supralaryngeal structures. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Unfortunately, the definition of three-dimensional models is time consuming (mainly because of the manual 3D meshing process) and consequently the number of analyses to be performed is limited. The authors have investigated a new patient-specific method allowing automatically 3D mesh generation for structures as complex as bone for example. This method, called the mesh-matching (M-M) algorithm, generated automatically customized 3D meshes of anatomical structures from an already existing model. The M-M algorithm has been used to generate FE models of 10 proximal human femora from an initial one which had been experimentally validated. The automatically generated meshes seemed to demonstrate satisfying results.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Most supervised classification methods are limited by the requirement for more cases than variables. In microarray data the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of cases (arrays), and thus filtering and pre-selection of genes is required. We describe the application of Between Group Analysis (BGA) to the analysis of microarray data. A feature of BGA is that it can be used when the number of variables (genes) exceeds the number of cases (arrays). BGA is based on carrying out an ordination of groups of samples, using a standard method such as Correspondence Analysis (COA), rather than an ordination of the individual microarray samples. As such, it can be viewed as a method of carrying out COA with grouped data. RESULTS: We illustrate the power of the method using two cancer data sets. In both cases, we can quickly and accurately classify test samples from any number of specified a priori groups and identify the genes which characterize these groups. We obtained very high rates of correct classification, as determined by jack-knife or validation experiments with training and test sets. The results are comparable to those from other methods in terms of accuracy but the power and flexibility of BGA make it an especially attractive method for the analysis of microarray cancer data.},

  Abstract                 = {This study compares the three-dimensional smooth surface shape of five adult patients with Crouzon's disease with nine normal skulls. A new analysis method is described which is based on smooth surface curvature. Surface samples are subdivided by a common ridge curve structure. Three-dimensional images of an average normal and an average Crouzon skull are illustrated. Comparisons between groups are performed on landmarks, as well as ridge curve and surface patch midpoints. There was as much discriminant information in the ridge curves and surface patches between landmarks as there was at the landmarks themselves. When compared with normal samples, the Crouzon's syndrome sample exhibits the following major characteristics: The mid-face is concave and wide, with the piriform aperture in the center more recessed than the perifery of the mid-face. The forehead is recessed above a frontal sinus bulge. The orbits are shallow, wide, concave, and tilted interiorly with a mild hypertelorism. These data suggest that advancement of large, one-piece osteotomy segments will not produce a normal face, and a multisegment approach should be considered., (C) 1995 Mutaz B. Habal, MD},

  Abstract                 = {Current methods for forensic DNA analysis require identification of a suspect for comparison purposes. The ability to determine the physical characteristics of the source of a crime scene sample would provide important investigative information. The most obvious descriptors of an individual's appearance are height, colouring and facial features. Since these traits are all highly heritable, as exemplified by the striking similarity of identical twins, it should be possible to determine the polymorphisms that cause the different traits. To date most work in this area has concentrated on pigmentation, since the genetic basis of hair, skin and eye colour is quite well understood. Over 120 genes have been identified in the mouse that affect coat and skin colour and the human homologues of these genes are known. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of these genes have been associated with various human hair, skin and eye colour phenotypes and a number of these SNPs have been shown to have functional affects.},

  Abstract                 = {A large-scale study of facial soft tissue depths of Caucasian adults was conducted. Over a 2-years period, 967 Caucasian subjects of both sexes, varying age and varying body mass index (BMI) were studied. A user-friendly and mobile ultrasound-based system was used to measure, in about 20 min per subject, the soft tissue thickness at 52 facial landmarks including most of the landmarks used in previous studies. This system was previously validated on repeatability and accuracy [S. De Greef, P. Claes, W. Mollemans, M. Loubele, D. Vandermeulen, P. Suetens, G. Willems, Semi-automated ultrasound facial soft tissue depth registration: method and validation. J. Forensic Sci. 50 (2005)]. The data of 510 women and 457 men were analyzed in order to update facial soft tissue depth charts of the contemporary Caucasian adult. Tables with the average thickness values for each landmark as well as the standard deviation and range, tabulated according to gender, age and BMI are reported. In addition, for each landmark and for both sexes separately, a multiple linear regression of thickness versus age and BMI is calculated. The lateral asymmetry of the face was analysed on an initial subset of 588 subjects showing negligible differences and thus warranting the unilateral measurements of the remaining subjects. The new dataset was statistically compared to three datasets for the Caucasian adults: the traditional datasets of Rhine and Moore [J.S. Rhine, C.E. Moore, Tables of facial tissue thickness of American Caucasoids in forensic anthropology. Maxwell Museum Technical series 1 (1984)] and Helmer [R. Helmer, Sch{\"a}delidentifizierung durch elektronische bildmischung, Kriminalistik Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg, 1984] together with the most recent in vivo study by Manhein et al. [M.H. Manhein, G.A. Listi, R.E. Barsley, R. Musselman, N.E. Barrow, D.H. Ubelbaker, In vivo facial tissue depth measurements for children and adults. J. Forensic Sci. 45 (2000) 48-60]. The large-scale database presented in this paper offers a denser sampling of the facial soft tissue depths of a more representative subset of the actual Caucasian population over the different age and body posture subcategories. This database can be used as an updated chart for manual and computer-based craniofacial approximation and allows more refined analyses of the possible factors affecting facial soft tissue depth.},

  Abstract                 = {Craniofacial reconstruction is important in forensic identification. It aims to estimate a facial appearance for human skeletal remains using the relationship between the soft tissue and the underlying bone structure. Various computerized methods have been developed in recent decades. An effective way is to deform a reference skull to the discovered skull, and then apply the same deformation to the skin associated with the reference skull to provide an approximate face for the discovered skull. For this method, the better the two skulls match each other, the more face-like the reconstructed skin surface will be. In this paper, we present a novel skull registration method that can match the two skulls closely, so as to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction. It combines both global and local deformations. A generic thin-plate spline (TPS)-based deformation, which is global, is applied first to roughly align the two skulls based on two groups of manually defined landmarks. Afterwards, the two skulls are largely matched, except some regions, on which some new landmarks are automatically marked. A compact support radial basis functions (CSRBF)-based deformation, which is local, will then be performed on these regions to adjust the initial alignment of the two skulls. Such adjustment can be repeatedly implemented until the two skulls have optimal alignment. In addition, all the skulls and face involved in the registration are represented by their single outer surfaces to facilitate the reconstruction procedure. The experiments demonstrate that our method can create a plausible face even when the reference skull is very different from the discovered skull. As a result, we can make full use of our database to provide multiple estimates for a principle components analysis (PCA) for the final reconstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of developmental instability (DI), as measured by fluctuating asymmetry (FA), in evolutionary biology has been the focus of a wealth of research for more than half a century. In spite of this long period and many published papers, our current state of knowledge reviewed here only allows us to conclude that patterns are heterogeneous and that very little is known about the underlying causes of this heterogeneity. In addition, the statistical properties of FA as a measure of DI are only poorly grasped because of a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive DI. If we want to avoid that this area of research becomes abandoned, more efforts should be made to understand the observed heterogeneity, and attempts should be made to develop a unifying statistical protocol. More specifically, and perhaps most importantly, it is argued here that more attention should be paid to the usefulness of FA as a measure of DI since many factors might blur this relationship. Furthermore, the genetic architecture, associations with fitness and the importance of compensatory growth should be investigated under a variety of stress situations. In addition, more focus should be directed to the underlying mechanisms of DI as well as how these processes map to the observable phenotype. These insights could yield more efficient statistical models and a unified approach to the analysis of patterns in FA and DI. The study of both DI and canalization is indispensable to obtain better insights in their possible common origin, especially because both have been suggested to play a role in both micro- and macro-evolutionary processes.},

It establishes three broad tendencies within Neanderthal reconstructions: following the expulsion of Neanderthals from 'humanity' in the nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century, the 1950s are characterized by a shift in this perception. From then, Neanderthals appear as essentially human creatures trapped in archaic bodies. Following this initial ideological oscillation the recent decades represent a parallel existence of both paradigms as well as a widening of conceptualizations. This paper argues that these ideological constructs remain operative, continuing to inform and form our perceptions of what Neanderthals are/are not.},

This approach has strong connections with multi-dimensional scaling, and the mean shape so defined gives good approximations to other commonly used definitions of mean shape.

  Abstract                 = {Like other organs, the nose changes as the body ages. A review of the literature reveals a basic understanding of the aging process in the nose but a paucity of documentation and few organized studies. This study was designed to identify systematically the age-related changes in the normal, nondiseased adult nose. A nasal-sinus laboratory was created, and a computerized patient database was developed. Four separate investigations were conducted. First, 111 subjects ranging in age from 21 to 94 years of age were studied prospectively using 135 variables. The following data were collected: history, symptoms, physical examination, rhinomanometry, ciliary beat frequency, smell testing, and incentive spirometry. Second, photographs of a separate group of 105 subjects 20 to 86 years of age were studied to ascertain the facial cephalometric changes that occur with aging. Third, a histopathologic examination of the nasal septum was performed in 20 additional subjects to evaluate the cellular changes that accompany aging. Finally, an epidemiologic study analyzing the prevalence of various nasal complaints by age was conducted, based on a review of more than 11,000 patient charts from surgeries and office visits. A number of specific age-related changes in the nose were identified, including an increased likelihood of certain nasal complaints, a pattern of increasing airflow resistance, and a decrease in physical abnormalities in the nasopharynx. The appearance of the nose, as measured by the nasolabial angle and the height/length ratio, was also found to change with age. Laryngoscope, 106:(suppl 81):1-25, 1996},

A survey is given of the determinants of mandibular stiffness and strength, including the mechanical properties and distribution of bone tissue and the size and shape of the mandible. Mandibular deformations, stresses, and strains that occur during static biting and chewing are reviewed. During biting and the powerstroke of mastication, a combination of sagittal bending, corpus rotation, and transverse bending occurs. The result is a complex pattern of stresses and strains (compressive, tensile, shear, torsional) in the mandible. To be able to resist forces and bending and torsional moments, not only the material properties of the mandible but also its geometrical design is of importance. This is reflected by variables like polar and maximum and minimum moments of inertia and the relative amount and distribution of bone tissue. In the longitudinal direction, the mandible is stiffer than in transverse directions, and the vertical cross-sectional dimension of the mandible is larger than its transverse dimension. These features enhance the resistance of the mandible to the relatively large vertical shear forces and bending moments that come into play in the sagittal plane.},

  Abstract                 = {Riedl's concept of burden neatly links development and evolution by ascertaining that structures that show a high degree of developmental co-dependencies with other structures are more constrained in evolution. The human skull can be precisely modeled as an articulated complex system of bones connected by sutures, forming a network of structural co-dependencies. We present a quantitative analysis of the morphological integration, modularity, and hierarchical organization of this human skull network model. Our overall results show that the human skull is a small-world network, with two well-delimited connectivity modules: one facial organized around the ethmoid bone, and one cranial organized around the sphenoid bone. Geometric morphometrics further support this two-module division, stressing the direct relationship between the developmental information enclosed in connectivity patterns and skull shape. Whereas the facial module shows a hierarchy of clustered blocks of bones, the bones of the cranial modules show a regular pattern of connections. We analyze the significance of these arrangements by hypothesizing specific structural roles for the most important bones involved in the formation of both modules, in the context of Riedl's burden. We conclude that it is the morphological integration of each group of bones that defines the semi-hierarchical organization of the human skull, reflecting fundamental differences in the ontogenetic patterns of growth and the structural constraints that generate each module. Our study also demonstrates the adequacy of network analysis as an innovative tool to understand the morphological complexity of anatomical systems. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

As a result, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have numerous opportunities to acquire and analyze images that depict persons of interest. Computer-Aided Forensic Facial Comparison is a comprehensive exploration of the scientific, technical, and statistical challenges facing researchers investigating courtroom identification from facial images. Supported by considerable background material, research data, and prototypic statistical and applications software, this volume brings together contributions from anthropologists, computer scientists, forensic scientists, and statisticians. Topics discussed include: * Face database collection in 3D * Error and distinguishing power associated with craniofacial landmarks * Statistical analysis of face shape variation * Comparison of instrumentation * Court admissibility issues * Missing data * Computer applications development Based on the quantification and analysis of more than 3000 facial images, this seminal work lays the foundation for future forensic facial comparison, computer applications development, and research in face shape variation and analysis. Using experimental and real case data, it demonstrates the influence of illumination, image resolution, perspective, and pose angle on landmark visibility. Two DVDs are included which contain the raw 3D landmark datasets for 3000 faces, additional datasets used in 2D analysis, and computer programs and spreadsheets used in analysis and in the development of prototypic applications software.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have examined mid-facial cold adaptation among either widely dispersed and genetically very diverse groups of humans isolated for tens of thousands of years, or among very closely related groups spread over climatically different regions. Here we present a study of one East Asian and seven North Asian populations in which we examine the evidence for convergent adaptations of the mid-face to a very cold climate. Our findings indicate that mid-facial morphology is strongly associated with climatic variables that contrast the temperate climate of East Asians and the very cold and dry climate of North Asians. This is also the case when either maxillary or nasal cavity measurements are considered alone. The association remains significant when mtDNA distances among populations are taken into account. The morphological contrasts between populations are consistent with physiological predictions and prior studies of mid-facial cold adaptation in more temperate regions, but among North Asians there appear to be some previously undescribed morphological features that might be considered as adaptive to extreme cold. To investigate this further, analyses of the seven North Asian populations alone suggest that mid-facial morphology remains strongly associated with climate, particularly winter precipitation, contrasting coastal Arctic and continental climates. However, the residual covariation among North Asian mid-facial morphology and climate when genetic distances are considered, is not significant. These findings point to modern adaptations to extreme climate that might be relevant to our understanding of the mid-facial morphology of fossil hominins that lived during glaciations.

  Abstract                 = {Books on regression and the analysis of variance abound-many are introductory, many are theoretical. While most of them do serve a purpose, the fact remains that data analysis cannot be properly learned without actually doing it, and this means using a statistical software package. There are many of these to choose from as well, all with their particular strengths and weaknesses. Lately, however, one such package has begun to rise above the others thanks to its free availability, its versatility as a programming language, and its interactivity. That software is R. In the first book that directly uses R to teach data analysis, Linear Models with R focuses on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. It clearly demonstrates the different methods available and more importantly, in which situations each one applies. It covers all of the standard topics, from the basics of estimation to missing data, factorial designs, and block designs, but it also includes discussion on topics, such as model uncertainty, rarely addressed in books of this type. The presentation incorporates an abundance of examples that clarify both the use of each technique and the conclusions one can draw from the results. All of the data sets used in the book are available for download from http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/LMR/. The author assumes that readers know the essentials of statistical inference and have a basic knowledge of data analysis, linear algebra, and calculus. The treatment reflects his view of statistical theory and his belief that qualitative statistical concepts, while somewhat more difficult to learn, are just as important because they enable us to practice statistics rather than just talk about it.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics and form the foundation of a vast range of statistical methodologies. Julian J. Faraway's critically acclaimed Linear Models with R examined regression and analysis of variance, demonstrated the different methods available, and showed in which situations each one applies. Following in those footsteps, Extending the Linear Model with R surveys the techniques that grow from the regression model, presenting three extensions to that framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect models, and nonparametric regression models. The author's treatment is thoroughly modern and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics, generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the use of neural networks in statistics. To demonstrate the interplay of theory and practice, throughout the book the author weaves the use of the R software environment to analyze the data of real examples, providing all of the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses. A supporting Web site at www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/ELM holds all of the data described in the book. Statisticians need to be familiar with a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book provides a well-stocked toolbox of methodologies, and with its unique presentation of these very modern statistical techniques, holds the potential to break new ground in the way graduate-level courses in this area are taught.},

  Abstract                 = {When anthropometric methods were introduced into clinical practice to quantify changes in the craniofacial framework, features distinguishing various races/ethnic groups were discovered. To treat congenital or post-traumatic facial disfigurements in members of these groups successfully, surgeons require access to craniofacial databases based on accurate anthropometric measurements. Normative data of facial measurements are indispensable to precise determination of the degree of deviations from the normal. The set of anthropometric measurements of the face in the population studied was gathered by an international team of scientists. Investigators in the country of the given ethnic group, experienced and/or specially trained in anthropometric methods, carried out the measurements. The normal range in each resultant database was then established, providing valuable information about major facial characteristics. Comparison of the ethnic groups' databases with the established norms of the North America whites (NAW) offered the most suitable way to select a method for successful treatment. The study group consisted of 1470 healthy subjects (18 to 30 years), 750 males and 720 females. The largest group (780 subjects, 53.1%) came from Europe, all of them Caucasians. Three were drawn from the Middle-East (180 subjects, 12.2%), five from Asia (300 subjects, 20.4%) and four from peoples of African origin (210 subjects, 14.3%). Their morphological characteristics were determined by 14 anthropometric measurements, 10 of them used already by classic facial artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht D{"u}rer, complemented by four measurements from the nasal, labio-oral and ear regions. In the regions with single measurements, identical values to NAW in forehead height, mouth width, and ear height were found in 99.7% in both sexes, while in those with multiple measurements, vertical measurements revealed a higher frequency of identical values than horizontal ones. The orbital regions exhibited the greatest variations in identical and contrasting measurements in comparison to NAW. Nose heights and widths contrasted sharply: in relation to NAW the nose was very or extremely significantly wide in both sexes of Asian and Black ethnic groups. Among Caucasians, nose height significantly differed from NAW in three ethnic groups, with one shorter and two greater. In the Middle Eastern groups nose width was identical to those of NAW but the height was significantly greater. The present study, conducted by investigators working separately across the world and with small samples of the population, is clearly preliminary in nature and extent. Yet it may fulfill its mission if medical and anthropological investigators continue the work of establishing normative data of the face. These data are urgently needed by medical professionals but have been lacking up till now in western and northern Europe, Asia, and Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to gain information about normal sex-related linear and angular dimensions of the orbital region; left-right symmetry; and growth changes between adolescence and mid-adulthood. The three-dimensional coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the orbits and face were obtained by an electromagnetic digitizer in 40 male and 33 female adolescents aged 12 to 15 years, 73 female and 89 male young adults aged 19 to 30 years, and 41 male and 38 female adults aged 31 to 56 years. From the landmarks-binocular and intercanthal widths; paired height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal (head in natural head position) and Frankfurt plane; length and inclination of the eye fissure; and the orbital height to eye fissure length ratio were calculated and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. Both the linear dimensions and the angular values were significantly larger in male subjects than in female subjects of corresponding age (p < 0.05). A significant effect of age was found (p < 0.05): while the linear distances and the orbital height-to-length ratio were greater in older people of the same sex, the inclination of the eye fissure decreased as a function of age. Both orbital inclinations were larger in the young adult group than in the adolescent and middle-aged groups. On average, the paired measurements were symmetrical, with similar values within each sex and age group. Data collected in this investigation could serve as a database for the quantitative description of human orbital morphology during normal adolescent and adult growth},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Face authentication is a biometric classification method that verifies the identity of a user based on image of their face. Accuracy of the authentication is reduced when the pose, illumination and expression of the training face images is different than the testing image. The methods in this paper are designed to improve the accuracy of a features-based face recognition system when the pose between the input image and training images are different. First, an efficient 2D-to-3D integrated face reconstruction approach is introduced to reconstruct a personalized 3D face model from a single frontal face image with neutral expression and normal illumination; Then, realistic virtual faces with different of pose are synthesized based on the personalized 3D face to characterize the face subspace; Finally, face recognition is conducted based on these representative virtual faces. Compared with other related works, this framework has the following advantages: 1) only one single frontal face is required for face recognition, which avoids the burdensome enrollment work; and, 2) the synthesized face samples provide the capability to conduct recognition under difficult conditions like complex pose, illumination and expression. From the experimental results show that the propose method improve the accuracy of face recognition with variant pose, illumination and expression.},

The study sample consisted of seven cadaver heads. The reliability and accuracy were assessed by means of a series of 21 standardized, linear facial measurements derived from 15 landmarks taken both directly on the face with a set of digital callipers and indirectly from a three-dimensional (3D) soft tissue surface models derived from CBCT, laser surface scans and 3D photographs. Statistical analysis for the reliability was done by means of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Accuracy was determined by means of the absolute error (AE) and absolute percentage error (APE) by comparison of the 3D measurements to the physical anthropometrical measurements. All the 3D scanning systems were proved to be very reliable (ICC0.923-0.999) when compared to the physical measurements (ICC; 0.964-0.999). Only one CBCT measurement (t-g) and one Di3D measurement (t-sn left) had a mean AE of more than 1.5mm. There are clear potential benefits of using 3D measurements appose to direct measurements in the assessment of facial deformities. Measurements recorded by the three 3D systems appeared to be both sufficiently accurate and reliable enough for research and clinical use.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of mandibular growth changes around the pubertal spurt in humans has several important implications for the diagnosis and orthopedic correction of skeletal disharmonies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate mandibular shape and size growth changes around the pubertal spurt in a longitudinal sample of subjects with normal occlusion by means of an appropriate morphometric technique (thin-plate spline analysis). Ten mandibular landmarks were identified on lateral cephalograms of 29 subjects at 6 different developmental phases. The 6 phases corresponded to 6 different maturational stages in cervical vertebrae during accelerative and decelerative phases of the pubertal growth curve of the mandible. Differences in shape between average mandibular configurations at the 6 developmental stages were visualized by means of thin-plate spline analysis and subjected to permutation test. Centroid size was used as the measure of the geometric size of each mandibular specimen. Differences in size at the 6 developmental phases were tested statistically. The results of graphical analysis indicated a statistically significant change in mandibular shape only for the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical vertebral maturation. Significant increases in centroid size were found at all developmental phases, with evidence of a prepubertal minimum and of a pubertal maximum. The existence of a pubertal peak in human mandibular growth, therefore, is confirmed by thin-plate spline analysis. Significant morphological changes in the mandible during the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical vertebral maturation may be described as an upward-forward direction of condylar growth determining an overall "shrinkage" of the mandibular configuration along the measurement of total mandibular length. This biological mechanism is particularly efficient in compensating for major increments in mandibular size at the adolescent spurt.}

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that the long-standing association of variability in the human nasal index [100 × (nasal breadth)/(nasal height)] with climatic variation is spurious evidence for natural selection in humans (Hoyme, 1965; St. Hoyme and Iscan, 1989). The argument is based principally on the observation that nasal height is globally more variable than nasal breadth, with nasal breadth thus contributing little to variation in the index. This argument does not take into account the confounding effect of absolute size of these variables on their variances. In this study we compare the intrinsic variation in skeletal nasal height and breadth within and among 26 mixed-sex populations (N = 2,408) at globally diverse localities (Howells, 1989), using 2 × 2 variance-covariance matrices of the logarithmically transformed variates. Hypothesis tests for homogeneity of matrices and equalvariance/equal-covariance indicate that the intrinsic variation in nasal breadth is greater than that for nasal height within populations, and that nasal breadth and nasal height exhibit equivalent intrinsic variation among populations. The argument that nasal breadth contributes little to the worldwide variation in the human nasal index is rejected. Given our present understanding of nasal physiological morpho-function, these results support, but do not demonstrate, an adaptive role for human nasal index variation. Promising methods for elucidating natural selection on human nasal form are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Methods for skeletal identification have a long history in physical and forensic anthropology. Recent literature demonstrates that new methods are constantly being developed, concurrent with refinements to those already commonly employed. The present study concerns the application of geometric morphometrics to assess the potential of mandibular morphology as a developmental marker for estimating age at death in subadult human skeletal remains. The sample comprises 79 known age and sex subadult individuals of South African Bantu and African American origin; 38 bilateral three-dimensional landmarks were designed and acquired using a portable digitizer. Linear regression was used to predict age using the multivariate descriptors of mandible size and shape based on configurations of three-dimensional landmarks. Our results show that the mandible can be used to predict age in the subadult skeleton with accuracy comparable to standards based on the dentition (standard error rates are between ±1.3 and ±3.0 years). These results closely parallel our previous study using the linear measurement of ramus height, but suggest that geometric morphometrics may be slightly more accurate when adolescents are included in the sample.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to compare linear dimensions made by traditional anthropometric techniques, and those obtained from three-dimensional coordinates, samples of four indigenous southern African populations were analysed. Linear measurements were obtained using mathematically transformed, three-dimensional landmark data on 207 male crania of Cape Nguni, Natal Nguni, Sotho and Shangaan. Univariate comparisons for accuracy of the transformed linear data were made with those in a traditional linear study by de Villiers (The Skull of the South African Negro: A Biometrical and Morphological Study. Witwatersrand University Press, Johannesburg) on similar samples and equivalent landmarks. Comparisons were not made with her Penrose (Ann Eugenics 18 (1954) 337) analysis as an apparently anomalous 'shape'- 'size' statistic was found. The univariate comparisons demonstrated that accurate linear measurements could be derived from three-dimensional data, showing that it is possible to simultaneously obtain data for three-dimensional geometric 'shape' and linear inter-landmark analyses. Using Penrose and canonical variates analyses of the transformed three-dimensional inter-landmark measurements, similar population distances were found for the four indigenous southern African populations. The inter-population distance relationships took the form of three separated pairs of distances, with the within-pair distances very similar in size. The cranial features of the four populations were found to be overall very similar morphometrically. However the populations were each shown by CVA to have population specific features, and using discriminant analyses 50% or more of the individual crania (with the exception of the Sotho) could be referred to their correct populations.}

  Abstract                 = {South Africa currently has a high homicide rate. This results in a large number of unidentified bodies being recovered each year, many of which are referred to the forensic examiner. This situation has resulted in considerable growth of forensic anthropological research devoted to devising standards for specific application in South African medico-legal investigations. The standards suitable for Black South Africans now encompass a wide variety of skeletal elements (e.g. cranium, humerus, pelvis, femur, patella, talus, calcaneus), each with differing degrees of accuracy. Apart from a preliminary investigation of the Zulu local population, however, we note that there appears to be no established metric mandible discriminant function standards for sex determination in this population. The purpose of the present study is to undertake a comprehensive analysis of sexual dimorphism in the mandible of Black South Africans, incorporating individuals from a selection of the larger local population groupings; the primary aim is to produce a series of metrical standards for the determination of sex. The sample analyzed comprises 225 non-pathological mandibles of Black South African individuals drawn from the R.A. Dart Collection. Nine linear measurements, obtained from mathematically transformed three-dimensional landmark data, are analyzed using basic univariate statistics and discriminant function analyses. All of the measurements examined are found to be sexually dimorphic; the dimensions of the ramus and corpus lengths are most dimorphic. The sex classification accuracy of the discriminant functions ranged from 70.7 to 77.3% for the univariate method, 81.8% for the stepwise method, and 63.6 to 84% for the direct method. We conclude that the mandible is a very useful element for sex determination in this population.},

We investigate here whether the mandible can discriminate immature individuals by sex; the techniques we apply are from the field of geometric morphometrics. The application of these methods in forensic anthropology is still relatively new; thus, an important aspect of this research is that it demonstrates potential applications in this discipline. The sample comprises 96 known age and sex subadult individuals; the three-dimensional coordinates of 38 landmarks are analyzed using the shape analysis software morphologika. Multivariate regressions indicated no significant sexual dimorphism in the subadult sample; this result is supported by poor cross-validated classification accuracy (59%). Our results suggest that the subadult mandible is not dimorphic (to the extent that dimorphism is not evident within the sample we studied); thus, sex determination using previously described criteria is likely to yield poor results.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, the study of metric skeletal asymmetry has relied largely on univariate analyses, utilizing ratio transformations when the goal is comparing asymmetries in skeletal elements or populations of dissimilar dimensions. Under this approach, raw asymmetries are divided by a size marker, such as a bilateral average, in an attempt to produce size-free asymmetry indices. Henceforth, this will be referred to as "controlling for size" (see Smith: Curr Anthropol 46 (2005) 249-273). Ratios obtained in this manner often require further transformations to interpret the meaning and sources of asymmetry. This model frequently ignores the fundamental assumption of ratios: the relationship between the variables entered in the ratio must be isometric. Violations of this assumption can obscure existing asymmetries and render spurious results. In this study, we examined the performance of the classic indices in detecting and portraying the asymmetry patterns in four human appendicular bones and explored potential methodological alternatives. Examination of the ratio model revealed that it does not fulfill its intended goals in the bones examined, as the numerator and denominator are independent in all cases. The ratios also introduced strong biases in the comparisons between different elements and variables, generating spurious asymmetry patterns. Multivariate analyses strongly suggest that any transformation to control for overall size or variable range must be conducted before, rather than after, calculating the asymmetries. A combination of exploratory multivariate techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis, and confirmatory linear methods, such as regression and analysis of covariance, appear as a promising and powerful alternative to the use of ratios.

  Abstract                 = {Objectives
Regional differences in modern human facial features are present at birth, and ontogenetic allometry contributes to variation in adults. However, details regarding differential rates of growth and timing among regional groups are lacking. We explore ontogenetic and static allometry in a cross-sectional sample spanning Africa, Europe and North America, and evaluate tempo and mode in two regional groups with very different adult facial morphology, the Khoisan and Inuit.

Materials and Methods
Semilandmark geometric morphometric methods, multivariate statistics and growth simulations were used to quantify and compare patterns of facial growth and development.

Results
Regional-specific facial morphology develops early in ontogeny. The Inuit has the most distinct morphology and exhibits heterochronic differences in development compared to other regional groups. Allometric patterns differ during early postnatal development, when significant increases in size are coupled with large amounts of shape changes. All regional groups share a common adult static allometric trajectory, which can be attributed to sexual dimorphism, and the corresponding allometric shape changes resemble developmental patterns during later ontogeny.

Discussion
The amount and pattern of growth and development may not be shared between regional groups, indicating that a certain degree of flexibility is allowed for in order to achieve adult size. In early postnatal development the face is less constrained compared to other parts of the cranium allowing for greater evolvability. The early development of region-specific facial features combined with heterochronic differences in timing or rate of growth, reflected in differences in facial size, suggest different patterns of postnatal growth.

  Abstract                 = {Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics (GM) is most often applied to problems of craniofacial shape variation. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of GM to the analysis of whole postcranial elements in a study of 77 hominoid tibiae. We focus on two novel methodological improvements to standard GM approaches: 1) landmark configurations of tibiae including 15 epiphyseal landmarks and 483 semilandmarks along articular surfaces and muscle insertions along the tibial shaft and 2) an artificial affine transformation that sets moments along the shaft equal to the sum of the moments estimated in the other two anatomical directions. Diagrams of the principal components of tibial shapes support most differences between human and non-human primates reported previously. The artificial affine transformation proposed here results in an improved clustering of the great apes that may prove useful in future discriminant or clustering studies. Since the shape variations observed may be related to different locomotor behaviors, posture, or activity patterns, we suggest that this method be used in functional analyses of tibiae or other long bones in modern populations or fossil specimens.

  Abstract                 = {The anatomical effects of artificial cranial deformation on the face and the base have been subject to various metric approaches, including standard linear as well as finite element techniques, and have produced controversial results (Ant{\'o}n [1989] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 79:253-267; Kohn et al. [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 90:147-158). It can be argued that diverging observations partly result from methodological constraints. The present study compares samples of intentionally deformed and undeformed human crania, using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), a morphometric approach which has been shown to be particularly appropriate for characterizing the shape of two-dimensional outlines and associated shape changes. We improve the standard EFA approach by adding a preliminary orientation of the outlines following the rotation parameters of a Procrustes superimposition, using multiple homologous landmarks called control points. The results confirm that circumferentially deformed skulls exhibit modifications of the basioccipital region, together with increased anterior and inferior facial projection. However, the degree to which basioccipital flattening is modified in circumferentially deformed Peruvians was found to be less marked than changes observed in the face. Some of the modifications observed here can be related to morphological trends existing in the population from which our sample was taken. The observation of other modifications may be subject to methodological constraints of standard morphometric approaches. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of dental morphology by means of geometric morphometric methods allows for a detailed and quantitative comparison of hominin species that is useful for taxonomic assignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. Upper second and third molars have been studied in a comprehensive sample of Plio- and Pleistocene hominins from African, Asian and European sites in order to complete our analysis of the upper postcanine dentition. Intraspecific variation in these two molars is high, but some interspecific trends can be identified. Both molars exhibit a strong reduction of the distal cusps in recent hominin species, namely European Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens, but this reduction shows specific patterns and proportions in the three groups. Second molars tend to show four well developed cusps in earlier hominin species and their morphology is only marginally affected by allometric effects. Third molars can be incipiently reduced in earlier species and they evince a significant allometric component, identified both inter- and intraspecifically. European Middle Pleistocene fossils from Sima de los Huesos (SH) show a very strong reduction of these two molars, even more marked than the reduction observed in Neanderthals and in modern human populations. The highly derived shape of SH molars points to an early acquisition of typical Neanderthal dental traits by pre-Neanderthal populations and to a deviation of this population from mean morphologies of other European Middle Pleistocene groups.},

There are reasons to believe that developmental stability and phenotypic quality are related. Recent studies of nonhuman animals indicate that developmental stability, measured as fluctuating asymmetry in generally bilateral symmetrical traits, is predictive of performance in sexual selection: Relatively symmetrical males are advantaged under sexual selection. This pattern is suggested by our study of facial attractiveness and fluctuating asymmetry in seven bilateral body traits in a student population. Overall, facial attractiveness negatively correlated with fluctuating asymmetry; the relation for men, but not for women, was statistically reliable. Possible confounding factors were controlled for in the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Qualitative methods of describing sexual dimorphism in discrete cranial traits have been criticized for their subjectivity and statistical limitations. However, researchers have yet to be able to accurately capture the morphology of these individual traits using traditional metric techniques. This article presents a method to quantify morphological variation in the skeletal browridge and chin using 3D surface laser scans. Browridge and chin regions are isolated from the skull using objectively defined landmarks and planes. Region areas and volumes are used to quantify absolute and relative size, while semilandmarks along transects are used for more detailed morphometric analyses. An intraobserver error study indicates high repeatability of the method. Application of the method is demonstrated on a sample of US males and females of black and white ancestries. Results suggest significant effects of both sex and ancestry on brow and chin morphologies and are consistent with traditional qualitative descriptions. Our results indicate that the method can accurately and reliably quantify browridge and chin morphologies, providing a tool to objectively describe and statistically analyze these traditionally qualitative discrete cranial traits.

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study is to quantify patterns of age-related shape change in the human thorax using Procrustes superimposition. Landmarks (n=106) selected from anonymized computed tomography (CT) scans of 63 adult males free of skeletal pathology were used to describe the form of the rib cage. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine a relationship between landmark location and age. Linear and quadratic models were also investigated. A permutation test employing 1×105 random trials was used to assess the model significance for both model formulations. Linear relationships between the centroid size (CS) of a landmark set and the corresponding individual's height, weight, and \{BMI\} were conducted to enable scaling of the dimensionless results from the Procrustes analysis. A significance level of a=0.05 was used for all tests. The average age of the study subjects was 57.0+- 17.3 years. Complete landmark sets were obtained from most of the scans (44 of 63). The quadratic relationship between the age and landmark location was found to be significant (p=0.037), thereby establishing a relationship between the age and thoracic shape change. The linear relationship was mildly significant as well (p=0.073). Significant relationships between the centroid size of the dataset and subject weight, height and \{BMI\} were determined, with the best-correlated value being weight (p=0.002, R2=0.22). Landmark datasets calculated using the quadratic model exhibited shape change consistent with the clinical observations (increasing kyphosis and rounding of the thoracic cage). Procrustes superimposition represents a potential improvement in the approach used to generate computational models for injury biomechanics studies. The coefficients from the quadratic model are provided and can be used to generate the complete set of model landmark data points at a given age.},

These studies also can help to understand some of the functional anatomical relationships within the orbit. This article attempts to review and illustrate the normal anatomical structures that can be identified on CT and MR images. These structures include the bony orbit, globe and optic nerve, extraocular muscles, lid retractor system, fibrous tissue framework, vascular system, neural structures, and lacrimal system.},

  Abstract                 = {Establishing reliable correspondences between object surfaces is a fundamental operation, required in many contexts such as cleaning up and completing imperfect captured data, texture and deformation trans- fer, shape-space analysis and exploration, and the automatic generation of realistic distributions of objects. We present a method for matching a template to a collection of possibly target meshes. Our method uses a very small number of user-placed landmarks, which we augment with automatically detected feature correspondences, found using spin images. We deform the template onto the data using an ICP-like framework, smoothing the noisy correspondences at each step so as to produce an averaged motion. The deformation uses a dierential representation of the mesh, with which the deformation can be computed at each iteration by solving a sparse linear system. We have applied our algorithm to a variety of data sets. Using only 11 landmarks between a template and one of the scans from the CEASAR data set, we are able to deform the template, and correctly identify and transfer distinctive features, which are not identied by user-supplied landmarks. We have also successfully established correspondences between several scans of monkey skulls, which have dangling triangles, non-manifold vertices, and self intersections. Our algorithm does not require a clean target mesh, and can even generate correspondence without trimming our extraneous pieces from the target mesh, such as scans of teeth.},

This result was not due to differential utilization of axes in the multidimensional perceptual space, nor to differences in verbal labeling.

  Abstract                 = {The association between nasal shape, prognathism and the shape of the maxillary dental arch has been examined within samples of Negro and European skulls. Prognathism tends to be accompanied by an increasingly broad and short nose. Particularly high correlations exist between nasal height and the length of the cranial base and between nasal breadth and the distance which separates the upper canine teeth. Regression analysis has yielded quantitative estimates of the effect on a given dimension of variation in one or more of the others. It seems probable that both nasal shape and the maxillary dental arch-prognathism complex may be subject to direct selection by environmental stress. The morphological association between these complexes suggests that a part of the interpopulation variation in prognathism may be a secondary effect of selection acting on the nose. Similarly, selection acting on the dental arch or maxilla could produce secondary changes in the nasal index (i.e. a non-adaptive component of nasal variation).},

Methods: Seventy-nine axial and sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the globe and orbit were studied. Any patients with pathology, as reported by the radiologists' findings, were excluded. Measurements were made on the images to determine the position of the globe relative to the bony orbit and to describe the configuration of the anterior face of the maxillary sinus. Clinical measurements were performed on photographs of 36 patients who underwent MRI scans. An independent observer rated these photographs for two clinical findings: inferior scleral show and tear trough deformity. Results: Correlations were found in the following sets of variables. (i) Corneal projection from infraorbital rim and corneal projection from lateral rim; (ii) corneal projection from supraorbital rim and corneal projection from lateral rim; (iii) s},

  Abstract                 = {Sex estimation of skeletal remains is an important issue in both forensics and bioarchaeology. The chance of attaining a high level of accuracy regarding sex allocations is related to the skeletal component analyzed and the ability of the techniques employed to describe shape and size differences among the sexes. Current opinion regards the hip bone as the most reliable sex indicator because it is the most dimorphic bone, particularly in adult individuals. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the greater sciatic notch and the ischiopubic complex morphology by employing geometric morphometric techniques, based on semilandmark and multivariate statistical methods, in order to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation. The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy of 90.9\% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with shape variables were 93.4\% and 90.1\% for discriminant and k-means, respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males, especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate between females and males.},

  Abstract                 = {Modifications of ontogenetic allometries play an important role in patterning the shape differentiation among populations. This study evaluates the influence of size variation on craniofacial shape disparity among human populations from South America and assesses whether the morphological disparity observed at the interpopulation level resulted from a variable extension of the same ontogenetic allometry, or whether it arose as a result of divergences in the pattern of size-related shape changes. The size and shape of 282 adult and subadult crania were described by geometric morphometric-based techniques. Multivariate regressions were used to evaluate the influence of size on shape differentiation between and within populations, and phylogenetic comparative methods were used to take into account the shared evolutionary history among populations. The phylogenetic generalized least-squares models showed that size accounts for a significant amount of shape variation among populations for the vault and face but not for the base, suggesting that the three modules did not exhibit a uniform response to changes in overall growth. The common slope test indicated that patterns of evolutionary and ontogenetic allometry for the vault and face were similar and characterized by a heightening of the face and a lengthening of the vault with increasing size. The conservation of the same pattern of shape changes with size suggests that differences in the extent of growth contributed to the interpopulation cranial shape variation and that certain directions of morphological change were favored by the trait covariation along ontogeny.

Great ape skeletal collections are thus an important and irreplaceable resource for researchers conducting these types of comparative analyses, yet the integrity of these collections is threatened by unnecessary use and their availability is threatened by financial pressures on the institutions in which the collections reside. We discuss the general history of great ape skeletal collections, and in order to get a better sense of the utility and potential of these important sources of data we assemble the equivalent of a biography of the Powell-Cotton Collection. We explore the history of how this collection of chimpanzee and gorilla skeletons was accumulated, how it came to be recognized as a potentially important source of comparative information, who has made use of it, and what types of data have been collected. We present a protocol for collecting information about each individual animal (e.g., which bones are preserved, their condition, etc.) and have made that information about the Powell-Cotton Collection freely available in an online relational database (Human Origins Database, www.humanoriginsdatabase.org). As an illustration of the practical application of these data, we developed a tabular summary of ontogenetic information about each individual (see Appendices A and B). Collections like the Powell-Cotton are irreplaceable sources of material regarding the hard-tissue evidence and recent history of the closest living relatives of modern humans. We end this contribution by suggesting ways that curators and the researchers who use and rely on these reference collections could work together to help preserve and protect them so that future generations can use and benefit from these priceless resources.

  Abstract                 = {Human orbit shape has been previously analyzed with a few non-specific landmarks or with subjective shape descriptions. This study uses elliptical Fourier analysis, a landmark-free method of measurement, to quantify the entire shape of the orbit and test the influence of sex, age, ancestry, and geographic location on orbit shape. Digital photographs were taken of 162 individuals of known sex, age and ancestry from the skeletal collections in Knoxville, Tennessee and Pretoria, South Africa. Orbit contours were traced from the photos and then analyzed in the elliptical Fourier program "SHAPE v. 1.3". Principal component (PC) values from SHAPE were analyzed for significant contributing variables using an ANCOVA. In the full sample, PCs 1,2, 4, and 5 were affected by at least one of the independent variables. Of these, geographical location figured prominently in 3 of the PCs. This underscores the importance of considering environmental effects over genetic ancestral affinities when analyzing human variation. Sex and the interaction between ancestry and continent of origin also significantly affected orbit shape. Although two PCs show some similarities to established descriptors of orbit shape, other components reveal more shape variation than have been previously prescribed. The corners of the orbits, features that are not captured in many current metric analyses, appear to play a significant role in shape variation. The technique used for this study proved to be effective in detecting significant contributing variables influencing human orbit shape. The study focused on descriptive analyses, but the quantitative data allows for the formulation of discriminant functions. These should not be hastily constructed as other variables associated with orbit shape remain unexplained.},

  Abstract                 = {Selection of the number of latent variables (LVs) to include in a partial least squares (PLS) model is an important step in the data analysis. Inclusion of too few or too many LVs may lead to, respectively, under or over-fitting of the data and subsequently result in poor future model performance. One well-known sign of over-fitting is the appearance of noise in regression coefficients; this often takes the form of a reduction in apparent structure and the presence of sharp peaks with a high degree of directional oscillation, features which are usually estimated subjectively. In this work, a simple method for quantifying the shape and size of a regression coefficient is presented. This measure can be combined with an indicator of model bias (e.g. root mean square error) to aid in estimation of the appropriate number of LVs to include in a PLS model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulated and and real NIR spectroscopy datasets sets and compared with several existing methods.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The modern human mandibular symphysis differs from those of all other primates in being vertically orientated and possessing a chin, but the functional significance of this unique morphology is not well understood. Some hypotheses propose that it is an adaptation to specific loads occurring during masticatory function. This study uses finite element analysis to examine these symphyseal loads in a model of a modern human mandible. By modifying the symphyseal cross-sectional form, the mechanical significance of the presence of the chin and symphyseal orientation is tested, and modern human and Neanderthal symphyseal cross-sections are compared with regard to their ability to withstand different loads. The results show that changes in symphyseal form have profound effects on the strains. The presence of a chin leads to lower symphyseal strains overall, whereas a vertical orientation of the symphysis results in higher strains under wishboning, but not under vertical bending in the coronal plane and dorsoventral shear. Compared to Neanderthals, the modern human symphysis shows higher strains during dorsoventral shear and wishboning, but is as effective as the Neanderthal symphysis in resisting vertical bending in the coronal plane and the loads resulting from simulated incision and unilateral molar biting. In general, the results of this study corroborate prior hypotheses about the mechanical effects of the human chin and vertical symphyseal orientation and support the idea that the relative importance of wishboning and vertical bending in the coronal plane might have played a role in the evolution of modern human symphyseal morphology.

  Abstract                 = {Fluctuating asymmetry is the most commonly used measure of developmental instability. Some authors have claimed that antisymmetry and directional asymmetry may have a significant genetic basis, thereby rendering these forms of asymmetry useless for studies of developmental instability. Using a modified Rashevsky-Turing reaction-diffusion model of morphogenesis, we show that both antisymmetry and directional asymmetry can arise from symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Concentrations of morphogen on right and left sides can be induced to undergo transitions from phase-locked periodicity, to phase-lagged periodicity, to chaos, by simply changing the levels of feedback and inhibition in the model. The chaotic attractor has two basins of attraction-right sidedominance and left side dominance. With minor disturbance, a developmental trajectory settles into one basin or the other. With increasing disturbance, the trajectory can jump from basin to basin. The changes that lead to phase transitions and chaos are those expected to occur with either genetic change or stress. If we assume that the morphogen influences the behavior of cell populations, then a transition from phase-locked periodicity to chaos in the morphogen produces a corresponding transition from fluctuating asymmetry to antisymmetry in both morphogen concentrations and cell populations. Directional asymmetry is easily modeled by introducing a bias in the conditions of the simulation. We discuss the implications of this model for researchers using fluctuating asymmetry as an indicator of stress.},

We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a binary image containing one or more objects. A signed distance transform assigns to each pixel (voxel, etc.), both inside and outside of any objects, the minimum distance from that pixel to the nearest pixel on the border of an object. By convention, the sign of the assigned distance value indicates whether or not the point is within some object (positive) or outside of all objects (negative). Over the years, many different algorithms have been proposed to calculate the distance transform of an image. These algorithms often trade accuracy for efficiency, exhibit varying degrees of conceptual complexity, and some require parallel processors. One algorithm in particular, the Chamfer distance [J. ACM 15 (1968) 600, Comput. Vis. Graph. Image Process. 34 (1986) 344], has been analyzed for accuracy, is relatively efficient, requires no special computing hardware, and is conceptually straightforward. It is understandably, therefore, quite popular and widely used. We present a straightforward modification to the Chamfer distance transform algorithm that allows it to produce more accurate results without increasing the window size. We call this new algorithm Dead Reckoning as it is loosely based on the concept of continual measurements and course correction that was employed by ocean going vessel navigation in the past. We compare Dead Reckoning with a wide variety of other distance transform algorithms based on the Chamfer distance algorithm for both accuracy and speed, and demonstrate that Dead Reckoning produces more accurate results with comparable efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {The notion of absence of the frontal sinuses in human individuals presenting a persistence of the metopic suture is considered as classical in many treatises of reference; however, precise studies are very rare and even controversial. The purpose of this study was thus to provide original data to confirm or refute this classical affirmation with the perspective of some original insights into biological significance of the frontal sinuses and the factors influencing their exceptional polymorphism. The material consisted of 143 dry skulls of adult individuals (European Homo sapiens), distributed in two groups: 80 skulls presenting a complete frontal closure with total disappearance of the metopic suture, and 63 skulls presenting a complete persistence of the metopic suture. Each skull was radiographed in oblique projection using the occipitomental view. A simple morphological quantification of the sinus size was defined with four categories: (1) aplasia, (2) hypoplasia, (3) medium size, (4) hyperplasia. Statistically significant difference in frontal sinusal size was found between both groups of skulls. Absent and small sinuses were considerably more frequent in skulls with persistence of the metopic suture (57.9 vs. 11.9%): small frontal sinuses (hypoplasia) were much more frequent (50.8 vs. 9.4%), although the frequency of absence of frontal sinuses (aplasia) was only slightly higher (7.1 vs. 2.5%)},

However, TPS forces the corresponding landmarks to exactly match each other, which is problematic when the localization of landmarks is prone to some error. Approximating TPS (ATPS) has been proposed to weak the interpolation condition. In ATPS, the regularization parameter plays an important role. It controls the smoothness of the transformation. Unfortunately, how to estimate is not solved. In this paper, estimation of the optimal regularization parameter has been proposed. It combines two evaluation factors, smoothness and location error hypothesis testing, to evaluate transformation results using fuzzy integral. The optimal regularization parameter is the best value maximizing the evaluation function. Experiments of the artificial grids and medial images show that our technique is feasible.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification in forensic anthropology and the definition of a biological profile in bioarchaeology are essential to each of those fields and use the same methodologies. Sex, age, stature and ancestry can be conclusive or dispensable, depending on the field. The Fordisc® 3.0 computer program was developed to aid in the identification of the sex, stature and ancestry of skeletal remains by exploiting the Forensic Data Bank (FDB) and computing discriminant function analyses (DFAs). Although widely used, this tool has been recently criticised, principally when used to determine ancestry. Two sub-samples of individuals of known sex were drawn from French (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;50) and Thai (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;91) osteological collections and used to assess the reliability of sex determination using Fordisc® 3.0 with 12 cranial measurements. Comparisons were made using the whole FDB as well as using select groups, taking into account the posterior and typicality probabilities. The results of Fordisc® 3.0 vary between 52.2% and 77.8% depending on the options and groups selected. Tests of published discriminant functions and the computation of specific DFA were performed in order to discuss the applicability of this software and, overall, to question the pertinence of the use of DFA and linear distances in sex determination, in light of the huge cranial morphological variability.},

Recent studies by Stephan and collaborators (6,8,10) reviewed traditional guidelines leading to a wrong placement of the eyeball in the orbit. As those statements are based on a small cadaver sample, we propose a validation of these findings on a large database (n = 375) of living people. Computed tomography scans of known age and sex subjects were used to collect landmarks on three-dimensional surfaces and DICOM with TIVMI. Results confirmed a more superior and lateral position of the eyeball relatively to the orbital rims. Orbital height and breadth were used to compute regression formulae and proportional placement using percentages to find the most probable position of the eyeball in the orbit. A size-related sexual dimorphism was present but did not impact on the prediction accuracy.},

Computed tomography scans of 78 living adults (n1) did not support any of these previously published recommendations. Free earlobes were found to accompany protruding supramastoid crests (Pearson < 0.05); and ear length [l] and width [w] differed by sex (p{\^A} <{\^A} 0.05), correlated with age (r{\^A} ={\^A} 0.38[l]; 0.32[w]), and correlated with facial height (r{\^A} ={\^A} 0.37[l]; 0.30[w]). New regression equations (for ear length and width) were generated using these variables in several samples and, where possible, cross-validated using independent data (n1{\^A} ={\^A} 78, n2{\^A} ={\^A} 2190, n3{\^A} ={\^A} 1328, n4{\^A} ={\^A} 1010, and n5{\^A} ={\^A} 47). As a result of these analyses, four valid and tested methods for ear prediction were identified, but large degrees of error continue to make accurate prediction of the ear, from the skull, problematic.},

For determination of the orbital volume, we used the imprint method; the remaining parameters were estimated. Our measurements showed a linear growth rate for the orbital width, height, and depth. After transformation to the cubic root, the values of the orbital volume also demonstrated a linear increase. The orbital index (height/width × 100) expressed the change in the oval outline of the orbital entrance during fetal development from a flat, wide form to a nearly round form at birth. No statistically significant difference between the right and left orbit was found.},

  Abstract                 = {Fourier outline shape analysis is a powerful tool for the morphometric study of two-dimensional form in organisms lacking many biologically homologous landmarks. Several improvements to the method are described herein; these modifications are incorporated into the new computer programs Hangle, Hmatch and Hcurve. First, automated tracing of outlines using image capture software, although desirable, results in high frequency pixel 'noise' that can corrupt the Fourier analysis. Program Hangle eliminates this noise using optional and variable levels of outline smoothing. Secondly, a widely used Fourier technique, elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA, Kuhl and Giardina 1982), yields coefficients that are not computationally independent of each other, a condition that hampers and compromises statistical analysis. In addition, EFA increasingly downweights successively more detailed features of the outline. Program Hangle solves both of these problems. Lastly, Fourier methods in general are sensitive to the placement of the starting position of the digitized trace. This problem is acute when the organisms under study have no unambiguously defined, homologous point on the outline from which to start the trace. Program Hangle allows the user to normalize for starting position using various properties of individual outlines. Alternatively, Hmatch takes a new approach and can be used to normalize using properties of the entire population under study.key words: Fourier shape analysis, morphometric studies, new computer programs, foraminiferal outlines.},

  Abstract                 = {This article demonstrates morphometric methods by applying them to an orthodontic sample. A total of 150 pretreatment cephalograms of consecutive patients (84 female, 66 male) were traced and digitized. Fifteen points were used for the analysis. The tracings were superimposed by the Procrustes method, and shape variability was assessed by principal component analysis. Approximately 70% of the total sample variability was incorporated in the first 5 principal components. The most significant principal component, accounting for 29% of shape variability, was the divergence of skeletal pattern; the second principal component, accounting for 20% of shape variability, was the anteroposterior maxillary relationship. It is recommended that Procrustes superimposition and principal component analysis be incorporated into routine cephalometric analysis for more valid and comprehensive shape assessment.}

  Abstract                 = {The people associated with the Jomon culture, the Neolithic inhabitants of Japan, are one of the key groups in the population history of East Asia, because they retain many archaic characters that may be traced back to Eurasian Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. In this study, the regional diversity of the Jomon skeletal series was estimated by applying the R-matrix method to 34 craniofacial measurements. The patterns of intraregional variation indicate little effect on the genetic structure of the Jomon from long-term gene flow stemming from an outside source. The regional diversities were further estimated by pooling all individuals into regional aggregates, and by computing the mean variance within local groups in each region. Although the pattern of phenotypic variation differs depending on the unit of analysis, the gradient of the diversity retains its identity. The Hokkaido region, the northernmost part of the Japanese archipelago, has the highest variance, followed by the regions of eastern Japan, while the southwestern regions have the lowest variance. These findings suggest that the Jomon ancestors of the northern part of Japan might have expanded southward to Honshu Island. Global analyses including samples from Eurasia, Africa, and Australia dating roughly to the same chronological periods as those of the Jomon samples, indicate that the Jomon cranial series share part of their ancestral gene pool with early northeastern Asians. The present findings support the archeologically suggested population growth and expansion in the northern half of the Eurasian continent during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods.

Recognition that the ordinary concept of race is not identical to the racialist concept of race makes it possible to ask whether there might be a legitimate place for the deployment of concepts of race in medical contexts. Two technical race concepts are considered. The concept of social race is the concept of a social group that is taken to be a racialist race. It is apt for use in examining and addressing the medical effects of discrimination. The populationist concept of race represents race as a kind of biological population. It makes it possible to frame the question whether biological race is a factor in disease susceptibility and drug responsiveness. It is apt for use in determining whether biological race is a medically significant category.},

  Abstract                 = {The classification and phylogenetic relationships of the middle Pleistocene human fossil record remains one of the most intractable problems in paleoanthropology. Several authors have noted broad resemblances between European and African fossils from this period, suggesting a single taxon ancestral to both modern humans and Neanderthals. Others point out 'incipient' Neanderthal features in the morphology of the European sample and have argued for their inclusion in the Neanderthal lineage exclusively, following a model of accretionary evolution of Neanderthals. We approach these questions using geometric morphometric methods which allow the intuitive visualization and quantification of features previously described qualitatively. We apply these techniques to evaluate proposed cranio-facial 'incipient' facial, vault, and basicranial traits in a middle-late Pleistocene European hominin sample when compared to a sample of the same time depth from Africa. Some of the features examined followed the predictions of the accretion model and relate the middle Pleistocene European material to the later Neanderthals. However, although our analysis showed a clear separation between Neanderthals and early/recent modern humans and morphological proximity between European specimens from OIS 7 to 3, it also shows that the European hominins from the first half of the middle Pleistocene still shared most of their cranio-facial architecture with their African contemporaries.},

  Abstract                 = {Cranial morphology is widely used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships, but its reliability in reflecting phylogeny and population history has been questioned. Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction.

By the guidance of standard methods, based on Farkas's anthropometric measurements in craniofacial region, 12 nasal soft tissue landmarks and 12 linear and 3 angular measurements were chosen. The linear measurements were taken directly, whereas the angular measurements were taken by photogrammetric method. Eight nasal proportion indices were calculated according to the linear measurements. The application of the independent-samples t-test showed sex dimorphism in most parameters of the nasal region. All the linear measurements were larger in men than in women, whereas all the angular measurements were smaller in men than in women. The significant differences in partial parameters between men and women have been proved. Ten of 12 linear measurements, 1 of 3 angular measurements, and 3 of 8 nasal proportion indices showed significant sexual dimorphism (P < 0.01). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, the nasal anthropometric measurements and proportion indices of Han Chinese adults were different, to some extent. This study could provide credible and objective reference material for plastic and maxillofacial surgeons for the external nasal soft tissue evaluation and planning of the cosmetic nasal surgery. Besides, these results could be a useful guidance for preoperative and postoperative evaluations of secondary rhinoplasty in nasal deformity associated with cleft lip and palate.},

  Abstract                 = {Regions in three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) brain images can be classified using protocols for manually segmenting and labeling structures. For large cohorts, time and expertise requirements make this approach impractical. To achieve automation, an individual segmentation can be propagated to another individual using an anatomical correspondence estimate relating the atlas image to the target image. The accuracy of the resulting target labeling has been limited but can potentially be improved by combining multiple segmentations using decision fusion. We studied segmentation propagation and decision fusion on 30 normal brain MR images, which had been manually segmented into 67 structures. Correspondence estimates were established by nonrigid registration using free-form deformations. Both direct label propagation and an indirect approach were tested. Individual propagations showed an average similarity index (SI) of 0.754&#xa0;{\^A}±&#xa0;0.016 against manual segmentations. Decision fusion using 29 input segmentations increased SI to 0.836&#xa0;{\^A}±&#xa0;0.009. For indirect propagation of a single source via 27 intermediate images, SI was 0.779&#xa0;{\^A}±&#xa0;0.013. We also studied the effect of the decision fusion procedure using a numerical simulation with synthetic input data. The results helped to formulate a model that predicts the quality improvement of fused brain segmentations based on the number of individual propagated segmentations combined. We demonstrate a practicable procedure that exceeds the accuracy of previous automatic methods and can compete with manual delineations.},

This intimate embryological relationship between the face and brain means that facial dysmorphogenesis can serve as an accessible and informative index of brain dysmorphogenesis in neurological and psychiatric disorders of early developmental origin. There are three principal challenges in seeking to increase understanding of disorders of early brain dysmorphogenesis through craniofacial dysmorphogenesis: (i) the first, technical, challenge has been to digitize the facial surface in its inherent three-dimensionality; (ii) the second, analytical, challenge has been to develop methodologies for extracting biologically meaningful shape covariance from digitized samples, making statistical comparisons between groups and visualizing in 3D the resultant statistical models on a 'whole face' basis; (iii) the third, biological, challenge is to demonstrate a relationship between facial morphogenesis and brain morphogenesis not only in anatomical2013embryological terms but also at the level of brain function. Here we consider each of these challenges in turn and then illustrate the issues by way of our own findings. These use human sexual dimorphism as an exemplar for 3D laser surface scanning of facial shape, analysis using geometric morphometrics and exploration of cognitive correlates of variation in shape of the 'whole face', in the context of studies relating to the early developmental origins of schizophrenia.},

The study of craniofacial form has generally been carried out either by interlandmark distance measurement and analysis or by observation and character scoring. In this study of four modern human groups (Eskimo/Inuit, African, Australian, and Romano-British), nine craniofacial landmark coordinates were recorded by extraction from laser scans. The coordinates were studied by geometric morphometrics, and a regression analysis was used to investigate the dominant variability in shape within and between groups. Statistical tests of shape difference between groups were carried out. By these methods, the statistical patterns of shape variability and their geometric interpretations were studied on a common basis. The results were found to be in agreement with the classic studies of Howells ([1989:189] Pap Peabody Mus 79), and show the potential of this approach for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {From a set of 31 three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans we model the temporal shape and size of the human mandible for analysis. simulation. and prediction purposes. Each anatomical structure is represented using 14 851 semi-landmarks, and mapped into Procrustes tangent space. Exploratory subspace analyses are performed leading to linear models of mandible shape evolution in Procrustes space. The traditional variance analysis results in a one-dimensional growth model. However, working in a non-Euclidean metric results in a multimodal model with uncorrelated modes of biological variation related to independent component analysis. The applied non-Euclidean metric is governed by the correlation structure of the estimated noise in the data. The generative models are compared, and evaluated on the basis of a cross validation study. The new non-Euclidean analysis is completely data driven. It not only gives comparable results w.r.t. previous studies of the mean modeling error, but seems to better correlate to growth, and in addition provides the data analyst with alternative hypothesis of plausible shape evolution; hence aiding in the understanding of cranio-facial growth.

  Abstract                 = {Not all detectable differences between face images correspond to a change in identity. Here we measure both sensitivity to change and the criterion difference that is perceived as a change in identity. Both measures are used to test between possible similarity metrics. Using a same/different task and the method of constant stimuli criterion is specified as the 50\% ?different? point (P50) and sensitivity as the Difference Limen (DL). Stimuli and differences are defined within a ?face-space? based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of measured differences in three-dimensional shape. In Experiment 1 we varied views available. Criterion (P50) was lowest for identical full-face view comparisons that can be based on image differences. When comparing across views P50, was the same for a static 45&#186; change as for multiple animated views, although sensitivity (DL) was higher for the animated case, where it was as high as for identical views. Experiments 2 and 3 tested possible similarity metrics. Experiment 2 contrasted Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance by setting PC1 or PC2 to zero. DL did not differ between conditions consistent with Mahalanobis. P50 was lower when PC2 changed emphasising that perceived changes in identity are not determined by the magnitude of Euclidean physical differences. Experiment 3 contrasted a distance with an angle based similarity measure. We varied the distinctiveness of the faces being compared by varying distance from the origin, a manipulation that affects distances but not angles between faces. Angular P50 and DL were both constant for faces from 1 to 2 standard deviations from the mean, consistent with an angular measure. We conclude that both criterion and sensitivity need to be considered and that an angular similarity metric based on standardised PC values provides the best metric for specifying what physical differences will be perceived to change in identity.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To describe the benefits of the stereolithography (SLA) modeling system in the evaluation and surgical planning of selected bony orbital pathology. Design: Two case reports. Participants: One patient presented with a displaced left orbital roof fracture into his orbit causing globe compression and binocular vertical diplopia. A second patient underwent removal of his right orbital floor, medial wall, and inferior portion of his lateral wall during excision of a cylindrical cell papilloma of the paranasal sinuses. Postoperatively, he suffered from globe ptosis and binocular oblique diplopia, Intervention: Stereolithographic models of the patients' orbits were obtained from computed tomography data to better assess the bony orbital pathology. In the second patient, the model was used as a template to create a temporary custom fit prosthesis to repair the defect of his orbital walls. Results: The SLA models were useful in evaluating the dimensions of the bony defects and in preoperative surgical planning. Intraoperatively, the SLA models facilitated orbital surgical rehabilitation. Postoperatively, both patients noted resolution of their diplopia after reconstruction of more normal bony anatomy. Conclusions: In selected cases, SLA offers highly accurate models of the bony orbit for preoperative evaluation, surgical planning, and teaching and can act as a template for custom prosthesis manufacturing, This technology increases the orbital surgeon's options in managing complex orbital pathology.},

A control group with minimal instruction and no training responded with 87.6% accuracy. A second group viewed 100 training pairs before the test and achieved 94.2% accuracy. A third group rated specific features in the images and had 0.1% improvement over the second group. Experimental results show that actively comparing at least thirty training images and receiving immediate feedback improves trainees performance six to seven percent. If a quantitative quality score is needed, a linear combination of similarity ratings on different features may be used.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand how variation in nasal architecture accommodates the need for effective conditioning of respired air, it is necessary to assess the morphological interaction between the nasal cavity and other aspects of the nasofacial skeleton. Previous studies indicate that the maxillary sinuses may play a key role in accommodating climatically induced nasal variation such that a decrease in nasal cavity volume is associated with a concomitant increase in maxillary sinus volume. However, due to conflicting results in previous studies, the precise interaction of the nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, in humans, is unclear. This is likely due to the prior emphasis on nasal cavity size, whereas arguably, nasal cavity shape is more important with regard to the interaction with the maxillary sinuses. Using computed tomography scans of living human subjects (N=40), the goal of this study is to assess the interaction between nasal cavity form and maxillary sinus volume in European- and African-derived individuals with differences in nasal cavity morphology. First, we assessed whether there is an inverse relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volumes. Next, we examined the relationship between maxillary sinus volume and nasal cavity shape using multivariate regression. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volume, indicating that the maxillary sinuses do not accommodate variation in nasal cavity size. However, maxillary sinus volume is significantly correlated with variation in relative internal nasal breadth. Thus, the maxillary sinuses appear to be important for accommodating nasal cavity shape rather than size. Anat Rec, 296:414-426, 2013.},

  Abstract                 = {Neandertals have been characterized as possessing features indicative of cold-climate adaptation largely based on ecogeographical morphological patterning found in recent humans. Interestingly, one character that deviates from this pattern is a relatively wide nasal aperture. The ecogeographical patterning of the nasal aperture in recent humans would predict instead that Neandertals should exhibit reduced nasal breadth dimensions. To explain this apparent anomaly it has been argued that a reduction in Neandertal nasal breadth was not possible due to dentognathic constraints on their midfaces via large anterior palatal breadth dimensions, especially large intercanine distances. A complicating factor in understanding the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth is that both measurements are also correlated with facial prognathism. It is, therefore, unknown to what degree the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth in Neandertals is a function of the pleisiomorphic retention of a prognathic facial skeleton. We used path analysis to test for a causal relationship between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth taking into account the potential effect of facial projection and facial prognathism (i.e., basion-nasion length and basion-prosthion length) using a large sample of geographically diverse recent and fossil Homo. Additionally, we examined the ontogenetic relationship between nasal breadth and intercanine breadth using a longitudinal human growth series to determine whether these variables exhibit similar growth trajectories. The results of these analyses indicate a weaker association between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth than expected, and that more variation in nasal breadth can be explained through basion-prosthion length rather than anterior palatal breadth dimensions. Moreover, the ontogenetic development of anterior palate breadth does not correspond to the growth trajectory of the breadth of the nose. These results explain the apparent paradox of wide piriform apertures in generally cooler climate-adapted Neandertals without resorting to dentognathic constraints, and provide additional insight into both the adaptive and nonadaptive (i.e., neutral) basis for Neandertal facial evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {As a component of the chondrocranium, the nasal septum influences the anteroposterior dimensions of the facial skeleton. The role of the septum as a facial growth center, however, has been studied primarily in long-snouted mammals, and its precise influence on human facial growth is not as well understood. Whereas the nasal septum may be important in the anterior growth of the human facial skeleton early in ontogeny, the high incidence of nasal septal deviation in humans suggests the septums influence on human facial length is limited to the early phases of facial growth. Nevertheless, the nasal septum follows a growth trajectory similar to the facial skeleton and, as such, its prolonged period of growth may influence other aspects of facial development. Using computed tomography scans of living human subjects (n = 70), the goal of the present study is to assess the morphological relationship between the nasal septum and facial skeleton in European- and African-derived populations, which have been shown to exhibit early developmental differences in the nasal septal premaxillary complex. First we assessed whether there is population variation in the size of the nasal septum in European- and African-derived samples. This included an evaluation of septal deviation and the spatial constraints that influence variation in this condition. Next, we assessed the relationship between nasal septal size and craniofacial shape using multivariate regression techniques. Our results indicate that there is significant population variation in septal size and magnitude of septal deviation, both of which are greater in the European-derived sample. While septal deviation suggests a disjunction between the nasal septum and other components of the facial skeleton, we nevertheless found a significant relationship between the size of the nasal septum and craniofacial shape, which appears to largely be a response to the need to accommodate variation in nasal septal size.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of cranial morphology to reflect population/phylogenetic history, and the degree to which it might be influenced by environmental factors and selection pressures have been widely discussed. Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways.

  Abstract                 = {Adult mandibles of 317 modern humans and 91 great apes were selected that showed no pathology. Adult mandibles of Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla gorilla and from 2 modern human populations (Zulu and Europeans from Spitalfields) were reliably sexed. Thirteen measurements were defined and included mandibular height, length and breadth in representative positions. Univariate statistical techniques and multivariate (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis) statistical techniques were used to investigate interspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in human and great ape mandibles, and intraspecific variability among the modern human mandibles. Analysis of interspecific differences revealed some pairs of variables with a tight linear relationship and others where Homo and the great apes pulled apart from one another due to shape differences. Homo and Pan are least sexually dimorphic in the mandible, Pan less so than Homo sapiens, but both the magnitude of sexual dimorphism and the distribution of sexually dimorphic measurements varied both among and between modern humans and great apes. Intraspecific variation among the 10 populations of modern humans was less than that generally reported in studies of crania (74.3% of mandibles were correctly classified into 1 of 10 populations using discriminant functions based on 13 variables as compared with 93% of crania from 17 populations based on 70 variables in one extensive study of crania). A subrecent European population (Poundbury) emerged as more different from a recent European population (Spitalfields) than other more diverse modern populations were from each other, suggesting considerable morphological plasticity in the mandible through time. This study forms a sound basis on which to explore mandibular variation in Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens and other more ancient fossil hominids.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the goals of anthropological research is to investigate biological human variation of past and present populations. Of particular interest is the study of sexual dimorphism, which can shed light on the human condition and aid in the identification of unidentified remains. When dealing with human skeletal remains, one of the four pillars of the anthropological protocol is the estimation of sex. Problems arise when applying sexing methods to different populations. Consequently, a skeletally robust female may appear to be "male", particularly in light of cross-population comparisons. The purpose of this study is to evaluate sexual dimorphism of the craniofacial complex in two local Portuguese samples (Coimbra, F= 40, M=39; Lisbon, F=27, M=28). An index of sexual dimorphism or ISD was used to assess the level of sexual dimorphism within each sample (Lisbon ISD=3.71; Coimbra ISD=3.07). The Student's t-test indicates that the degree of sexual dimorphism is not significantly different between Coimbra and Lisbon (P=0.31). However, Mahalanobis distance, which was computed to examine differences among the groups, indicates that Lisbon females differ significantly from the other samples and the pattern of sexual dimorphism coincides with the ISD results. The disparity of the Lisbon females may indicate the possible influence of immigration or genetic diversity left behind by the numerous population influxes on the Iberian Peninsula and warrants further study.},

This study evaluates the practical value of these estimations. Orbital height and breadth were measured to determine the orbital index and assess differences between men and women or black people and white people in the Hamann-Todd Collection. Replicability of these measures was also examined. Finally, a geometric morphometric study was performed to assess shape differences using the entire margin. Significant differences were found in both the index and the geomorphometric study; however, further investigation revealed that the differences were of little practical use. The measurement differences were found to be smaller than intra-observer error, while the geometric morphometric analysis demonstrated that minimal percentage of variation in shape was attributable to group differences. Thus, these techniques should not be used to estimate sex or race.},

However, there is no precise study about the localization of vital orbital structures from reliable periorbital bony anatomy of the Korean adult. This study was constructed to give pertinent anatomical measurements to which the plastic and maxillofacial surgeon may refer. The 82 orbits obtained from 41 skulls of adult Koreans were measured with Vernier calipers and Marshac calipers. Superiorly, the supraorbital fissure was 40.0 +/- 2.5 mm from the supraorbital notch. Medially, the posterior ethmoidal foramen was 31.7 +/- 3.0 mm from the anterior lacrimal crest. Inferiorly, the infraorbital fissure where the infraorbital groove started was 26.4 +/- 2.6 mm from the infraorbital foramen. Laterally, the supraorbital fissure was 34.3 +/- 2.7 mm from the frontozygomatic suture. These distances are suggested as appropriate safe distances from each periorbital bony landmark. Dissection beyond that distance should be done with great caution.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study is to test various masticatory-stress hypotheses about the evolution and function of well-developed browridges of higher primates. This was done by measuring and analyzing patterns of in vivo bone strain recorded from three-element rosette strain gages bonded to the supraorbital region and to other portions of the bony face of Macaca fascicularis and Papio anubis during mastication and incision. The magnitude and direction of the principal strains recorded support Endo's hypothesis that the supraorbital region during mastication and incision is bent in the frontal plane (Endo, 1966). Our data do not, however, support his hypothesis that the supraorbital region is bent more during incision than during mastication. The data also demonstrate that overall levels of supraorbital strain are not larger in more prognathic subjects. Most importantly, the data indicate that the supraorbital region of nonhuman catarrhines is strained very little during mastication and incision. This indicates that there is much more supraorbital bone than is necessary both to counter masticatory loads and to provide an adequate safety factor to failure for these loads. This in turn suggests that the macaque and baboon browridges can be considerably reduced in size and still maintain these required structural characteristics. Thus, our experiments provide no support whatsoever for those hypotheses that directly link browridge morphology to masticatory stress (cf. Endo, 1966; Russell, 1983, 1985). A recent review of Endo's original work indicates that this latter statement is also true for humans (Picq and Hylander, 1989). We conclude, therefore, that there is no good reason to believe that enlarged browridges in living and/or fossil primates are structural adaptations to counter intense masticatory forces. The evolution of browridge morphology in primates is best explained on the basis of factors related to the position of the brain relative to the orbits (Moss and Young, 1960). When these structures are widely separated, as in gorillas, the large intervening space must be bridged with bone. In addition, enough bone must be present within the supraorbital and bridged regions to prevent structural failure due to non-masticatory external forces associated with highly active primates (e.g., accidental traumatic forces applied to the orbits and neurocranium). This requirement results in both pronounced browridges and in much more supraorbital bone than is necessary to counter routine cyclical stress during mastication and incision. This in turn explains why bone strains recorded from the supraorbital region are extremely small relative to other portions of the primate face during mastication and incision.},

The purpose of this paper is to assess Romanian sexual dimorphism by discriminant function analysis and to compare the results with those of other Caucasians. The sample is composed of 50 males and 50 females specimens, with known age and sex, belonging to the Francisc; Ramer collection (Bucharest). The individuals of the collection died during 1920 to 1940 in hospitals to where they came from many regions of the country, especially from unprivileged sociocultural milieu. The mean age is 35.57 years for males and 33.20 for females (statistically not significant). A total of seven mandibular dimensions are taken according to the Martin procedure by the senior author. Data are analyzed initially through direct method of discriminant analysis statistic (SPSS). This has provided 86.7% accuracy. When the same dimensions are analyzed with the stepwise procedure, five of them (height of ascending ramus, bigonial breadth, mandibular length, mandibular symphysis height, minimum breadth of ascending ramus) are selected. Classification accuracy has remained the same (86.7%). This suggests that sexual dimorphism is also well pronounced in the country with an accuracy rate as high as other Caucasoid population, such as South African and American whites.},

  Abstract                 = {A vital aspect of skeletal analysis is the determination of population affinity of an unknown individual. The aim of this paper is to develop discriminant function formulae to determine race from craniometric dimensions of South African blacks and whites. Skeletons used in this study came from the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria. The sample is composed of 53 white males and 53 white females and 45 black males and 45 black females. Using 13 standard cranial and 4 mandibular dimensions, average accuracies of 98% were obtained from the crania, which were much more discriminatory than the mandibles (74% males, 87% females). When a "leave-one-out classification" technique was applied to the sample to measure accuracy of multivariate classification, this accuracy was about the same as obtained from the multivariate function. A posterior probability of 0.80 or more was found in as much as 96% of the sample, Stepwise discriminant function formulae for incomplete remains (vault and face) were also derived. Prediction accuracy was considerably lower when North American based formulae were tested on the South Africans, indicating significant craniometric differences between these populations.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique serves as a practical tool in diagnosis, surgical planning, and outcome prediction of plastic and reconstructive surgery. In our study, the morphologic features of the Chinese adult orbit were described by 11 anatomic parameters using a 3D reconstruction technique. Sixty-four Chinese adults were selected randomly from patients who had undergone craniofacial computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose conditions other than craniofacial or orbital deformations. The morphologic parameters of orbit such as bony orbital volume, orbital foramen area and orbital rim perimeter were measured on 3D models using this technique. Differences between the two orbits and between the two sexes were investigated. The method of measurement showed high reproducibility of results. No difference between the two orbits was found. There were significant differences between men and women in all anatomic parameters other than orbital height. In men and women, respectively, mean bony orbital volume was 26.02 and 23.32 mL, mean orbital foramen area 11.80 and 11.10 cm2, mean orbital rim perimeter 12.65 and 12.20 cm, mean orbital height 33.35 and 33.22 mm, mean orbital width 40.02 and 38.00 mm; mean orbital floor length 47.93 and 46.18 mm, mean orbital roof length 52.93 and 50.89 mm, mean medial orbital wall length 46.43 and 44.41 mm, mean lateral orbital wall length 48.38 and 46.91 mm, mean intraorbital distance 27.18 and 25.11 mm, mean extra-orbital distance 98.77 and 93.69 mm. It is concluded that the measurements of these orbital parameters could be obtained from a 3D reconstruction method. The two orbits were symmetric based on orbital volume and other anatomic parameters. Orbital size was significantly smaller in women than in men; orbital height, however, was similar. The findings of the present study allow for quantification of the orbital features of Chinese adults and provide parameters for preoperative planning and prediction of postoperative outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Secular trends in the facial skull over three Central European samples spanning more than 13 centuries were examined. Data were 43 conventional cephalometric landmark points for samples dating from 680 to 830 AD (29 male Avars), from the mid-19th century (49 adult Hapsburg Monarchy males), and from the 20th century (54 living Austrian young adult males). Analyses by standard methods of geometric morphometrics demonstrated shape differences by data and by size, with a strong interaction of these with sample, in that group mean differences were different for small and large individuals (allometry is different from period to period). The oldest sample, from the Migration Period, exhibited allometric features that may possibly be Turkic. There are implications for the orthodontist interested in growth trends or growth predictions in ethnically mixed patient samples.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Alexander Ecker collection in Freiburg/Br. is one of the larger university collections and contains a variety of human skulls from archaeological contexts and modern samples of skulls deriving from all over the world. Today it belongs to the University Museum. Started during the 1850s by the anthropologist Alexander Ecker, the collection grew steadily over time but signifi cant losses were incurred by two World Wars, several relocations as well as changes in the archiving system. This led to the current situation in which information pertaining to the preserved skulls is scarce. Because of this state of preservation, the scientifi c value of the collection is limited. The responsible curation of the collection involves the determination of provenience as well as identifying the context of acquisition for each of the skulls. For selected individuals we believe that a thorough analysis of his- torical sources and the skulls is a suitable way of producing a solidly based package of information to serve as background for future scientifi c use, historical interest and repatriation claims.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to determine the morphometric variations from various reference points to decrease risks in orbital surgery. Sixty-two orbits obtained from 31 skulls of male adult Caucasians were measured with a millimetric compass. On the medial orbital wall, the midpoint of the anterior lacrimal crest was the reference point; from this point we measured distances of 23.9 +/- 3.3 mm, 35.6 +/- 2.3 mm, 41.7 +/- 3.1 mm and 6.9 +/- 1.5 mm respectively to the anterior ethmoidal foramen, posterior ethmoidal foramen, midpoint of the medial aspect of the optic canal and posterior lacrimal crest. On the same wall, distances from the plane of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina to the ethmoido-maxillary suture and distance from the posterior ethmoidal foramen to the anterior ethmoidal foramen and midpoint of the medial margin of the optic canal were 14.9 +/- 2.3 mm, 9.8 +/- 2.9 mm and 6.8 +/- 2.2 mm respectively. On the inferior orbital wall, the main reference point was the infraorbital foramen, and from this point to the midpoints of the lateral margin of the fossa for the lacrimal gland, inferior orbital fissure, inferior orbital rim and inferior aspect of the optic canal was 23.8 +/- 7.2 mm, 31.9 +/- 3.9 mm, 6.7 +/- 1.9 mm and 50.3 +/- 3.2 mm respectively. On the superior orbital wall, the distances from the supraorbital foramen to the midpoints of the superior orbital fissure, fossa for the lacrimal gland and superior aspect of the optic canal were 45.7 +/- 3.6 mm, 26.0 +/- 2.5 mm and 45.3 +/- 3.2 mm respectively. Furthermore, on the same wall, the distance from the posterior ethmoidal foramen to the midpoint of the superior orbital fissure was 14.6 +/- 2.8 mm. Finally, on the lateral orbital wall the frontozygomatic suture was the reference point. From this point distances to the midpoints of the fossa for the lacrimal gland, superior orbital fissure, lateral aspect of the optic canal and inferior orbital fissure were 17.5 +/- 2.1 mm, 37.7 +/- 3.6 mm, 44.9 +/- 12.5 mm and 33.4 +/- 3.1 mm respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {This study assessed three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry as a tool for capturing and quantifying human skull morphology. While virtual reconstruction with 3D surface scanning technology has become an accepted part of the paleoanthropologist's tool kit, recent advances in 3D photogrammetry make it a potential alternative to dedicated surface scanners. The principal advantages of photogrammetry are more rapid raw data collection, simplicity and portability of setup, and reduced equipment costs. We tested the precision and repeatability of 3D photogrammetry by comparing digital models of human crania reconstructed from conventional, 2D digital photographs to those generated using a 3D surface scanner. Overall, the photogrammetry and scanner meshes showed low degrees of deviation from one another. Surface area estimates derived from photogrammetry models tended to be slightly larger. Landmark configurations generally did not cluster together based upon whether the reconstruction was created with photogrammetry or surface scanning technology. Average deviations of landmark coordinates recorded on photogrammetry models were within the generally allowable range of error in osteometry. Thus, while dependent upon the needs of the particular research project, 3D photogrammetry appears to be a suitable, lower-cost alternative to 3D imaging and scanning options.

We prepared the four directional feature fields on multiple <span class='snippet'>facial</span> parts images, such as face, <span class='snippet'>jaw</span>, lip, nose, eyes, and R eye. Then, we recognized these images by using the linear discriminate analysis. Furthermore, we analyzed the feature space by using within-class variance between-class variance ratio. After experimenting on a large number of subjects, we conclude that face and <span class='snippet'>jaw</span> make good feature spaces. Moreover, we discovered that <span class='snippet'>recognition</span> rate changes with ages. Accordingly, a possibility that each man and woman had the age, which is easy to distinguish gender, was suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {There will always be criminal cases, where the evidence DNA sample will not match either a suspect's DNA profile, or any in a criminal DNA database. In the absence of DNA-based mass intelligence screenings, including familial searching (both of which may be restricted by legislation), there is only one option to potentially avoid or retrospectively solve "cold cases": the DNA-based prediction of human externally visible characteristics of an unknown person based on the crime scene sample left behind. Predictive DNA markers are expected to be available for some group-specific appearance traits in the near future; although it is unlikely that we will soon be able to understand the biological complexity of individual-specific appearance. In suspect-less cases reliable DNA-based prediction of broader externally visible characteristics from crime scene samples are expected to reduce the potential pool of suspects by allowing police investigations to concentrate on specific groups of people. Here, we aim to describe the forensic motivations for DNA-based prediction of human externally visible traits as well as the scientific challenges of finding predictive DNA markers, and will discuss examples with promising (e.g. sex, eye color and hair color), as well as less promising expectations (e.g. adult body height), in the foreseen future. Despite the complex ethical and legal implications arising from DNA-based prediction of externally visible characteristics, we argue that their use does not lead to a violation of privacy. We suggest that likelihood-based results, rather than DNA data itself, should be provided to the police for investigative purposes avoiding data protection issues. Furthermore, we note that the risk of exacerbating social pressure on minority groups due to DNA-based prediction of externally visible traits in crime cases may be reduced rather than increased compared to a conventional eyewitness testimony. A firm legal basis will need to be established for the application of these promising qualitative techniques. To gain the attention of legislative bodies, we invite the forensic community to participate in a public discourse of these issues.},

When m = 1, we find that Formulawhen m = 3, the shape-space contains singularities. This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space Formula can be identified with a version of CPk-2. Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CPk-2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established.},

The main object of the paper is to obtain asymptotic formulae for EN({\^I}µ) and Var(N({\^I}µ)) when $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$ , and to solve the associated data-analytic problem of testing whether an empirical set of n points should be considered to contain too many such {\^I}µ -blunt triads in the situation where the generating mechanism is unknown and where all that can be said about the tolerance {\^I}µ is that it must be allowed to take values anywhere in a given interval (T0,T1) $(0<T_{0}<T_{1})$ . This problem is solved by the introduction of a plot to be called the pontogram and by the introduction of simulation-based significance tests constructed by random lateral perturbations of the data.},

  Abstract                 = {Intentional cranial deformations (ICD) have been observed worldwide but are especially prevalent in preColombian cultures. The purpose of this study was to assess the consequences of ICD on three cranial cavities (intracranial cavity, orbits, and maxillary sinuses) and on cranial vault thickness, in order to screen for morphological changes due to the external constraints exerted by the deformation device. We acquired CT-scans for 39 deformed and 19 control skulls. We studied the thickness of the skull vault using qualitative and quantitative methods. We computed the volumes of the orbits, of the maxillary sinuses, and of the intracranial cavity using haptic-aided semi-automatic segmentation. We finally defined 3D distances and angles within orbits and maxillary sinuses based on 27 anatomical landmarks and measured these features on the 58 skulls. Our results show specific bone thickness patterns in some types of ICD, with localized thinning in regions subjected to increased pressure and thickening in other regions. Our findings confirm that volumes of the cranial cavities are not affected by ICDs but that the shapes of the orbits and of the maxillary sinuses are modified in circumferential deformations. We conclude that ICDs can modify the shape of the cranial cavities and the thickness of their walls but conserve their volumes. These results provide new insights into the morphological effects associated with ICDs and call for similar investigations in subjects with deformational plagiocephalies and craniosynostoses.},

Along with radiographs and CT images, the frontal sinus is often used for the individual identification because of its unique and unchangeable characteristics. The purpose of this study is to define the usefulness of three-dimensional (3-D) images of the frontal sinus for identification. CT images from 119 Korean cadavers were built up for 3-D reconstruction and surveyed with 15 measurements. The total volume of the sinus, some nonmetric characteristics, and the bilateral asymmetry index in men differed significantly from those in women (p{\^A} <{\^A} 0.05). The digit codes, six sections and 10-digit number, were almost able to accurately identify individuals (98%). This study showed a statistical difference between the sexes and classified the fused and prominent middle sinuses for the first time. This proposed method for identification is more accurate than those used in other studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: The periorbita has been regarded as the critical structure in decision of exenteration in the patients with paranasal (PNS) malignancies. The purpose of this study is to present the CT and MRI findings of the periorbita with PNS malignancies. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with PNS cancers were chosen for this study. PNS CT and MRI scans were performed on all patients. The imaging findings were reviewed retrospectively by consensus of two neuroradiologists. Assessment of the defect of the orbital bone and invasion of the orbital fat was made by CT and MRI. The signal intensity (SI) thickness, enhancement, and correlation with the orbital bone of the periorbita were analyzed on MRI. The intraoperative and pathologic reports were used as the gold standard for orbital invasion. Results: In patients with bone defects, it was impossible to differentiate the periorbita from the mass on CT. The periorbita showed hypointensity on T2-weighted images compared with the SI of mass. On Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images, the periorbita showed less enhancement than the mass in nine patients. Six patients showed two hypointense layers (the outer bony wall and the inner periorbita) between the mass and orbital fat on T2-weighted images. The thickness of the periorbita was 0.79-1.4 millimeter. Orbital invasion was more conspicuous on T2-weighted coronal images than on the CT images. Conclusions: MRI was more conspicuous for detecting orbital invasion than CT. The mass beyond the thickened periorbita on T2-weighted images was considered to be a positive finding of orbital invasion.},

  Abstract                 = {The purposes of this study were to evaluate the asymmetry of the sphenoid bone and to determine its suitability as a reference for analyzing asymmetry of the skull. Thirty-seven dry skulls from India were divided into group A (n = 18), with a right-left length discrepancy of less than 2 mm for both the external acoustic meatus-frontozygomatic suture and external acoustic meatus-subspinale, and group B (n = 19), with a right-left length discrepancy of more than 2 mm for either of these 2 parameters. The skulls were then examined with regard to the percentage of asymmetry of the sphenoid bone, the angles between the cranial base and the facial axis, and the distance between reference surfaces of the sphenoid bone and facial landmarks by 3-dimensional measurement system. The following results were obtained: 1. Asymmetry of the sphenoid bone, while slight, was found in both groups. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups. 2. The cranial base and the facial axis did not form a right angle in group A, and there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. 3. The distances between reference surfaces of the sphenoid bone and the lower landmarks of the facial bone were greater than those of the upper landmarks. 4. The external acoustic meatus was the most suitable reference for analysis of craniofacial asymmetry.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: One of the four pillars of the anthropological protocol is the estimation of sex. The protocol generally consists of linear metric analysis or visually assessing individual skeletal traits on the skull and pelvis based on an ordinal scale of 120135, ranging from very masculine to very feminine. The morphologic traits are then some how averaged by the investigator to estimate sex. Some skulls may be misclassified because of apparent morphologic features that appear more or less robust due to size differences among individuals. The question of misclassification may be further exemplified in light of comparisons across populations that may differ not only in cranial robusticity but also in stature and general physique. The purpose of this study is to further examine the effect of size and sex on craniofacial shape among American populations to better understand the allometric foundation of skeletal traits currently used for sex estimation. Three-dimensional coordinates of 16 standard craniofacial landmarks were collected using a Microscribe-3DX digitizer. Data were collected for 118 American White and Black males and females from the W.M. Bass Donated Collection and the Forensic Data Bank. The MANCOVA procedure tested shape differences as a function of sex and size. Sex had a significant influence on shape for both American Whites (F = 2.90; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.0024) and Blacks (F = 2.81; d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.0035), whereas size did not have a significant influence on shape in either Whites (F = 1.69; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.08) or Blacks (F = 1.09; d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.40). Therefore, for each sex, individuals of various sizes were statistically the same shape. In other words, while significant differences were present between the size of males and females (males on average were larger), there was no size effect beyond that accounted for by sex differences in size. Moreover, the consistency between American groups is interesting as it suggests that population differences in sexual dimorphism may result more from human variation in size than allometric variation in craniofacial morphology.},

  Abstract                 = {Directional asymmetry, the systematic differences between the left and right body sides, is widespread in human populations. Changes in directional asymmetry are associated with various disorders that affect craniofacial development. Because facial dysmorphology is a key criterion for diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the question arises whether in utero alcohol exposure alters directional asymmetry in the face. Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero. These results suggest that the developmental consequences of fetal alcohol exposure affect a wide range of craniofacial features in addition to those generally recognized and used for diagnosis of FAS.},

  Abstract                 = {Morphometric studies often consider parts with internal left-right symmetry, for instance, the vertebrate skull. This type of symmetry is called object symmetry and is distinguished from matching symmetry, in which two separate structures exist as mirror images of each other, one on each body side. We explain a method for partitioning the total shape variation of landmark configurations with object symmetry into components of symmetric variation among individuals and asymmetry. This method is based on the Procrustes superimposition of the original and a reflected copy of each landmark configuration and is compatible with the two-factor ANOVA model customary in studies of fluctuating asymmetry. We show a fully multivariate framework for testing the effects in the two-factor model with MANOVA statistics, which also applies to shapes with matching symmetry. We apply the new methods in a small case study of pharyngeal jaws of the Neotropical cichlid fish Amphilophus citrinellus. The analysis revealed that the symmetric component of variation in the pharyngeal jaws is dominated by the contrast between two alternative trophic morphs in this species and that there is subtle but statistically significant directional asymmetry. Finally, we provide some general recommendations for morphometric studies of symmetric shapes.},

  Abstract                 = {Although fluctuating asymmetry has become popular as a measure of developmental instability, few studies have examined its developmental basis. We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks. This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability) and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry. We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to be involved in the development of fly wings.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to clarify the morphological uniqueness of the human eye and to obtain cues to understanding its adaptive significance, we compared the external morphology of the primate eye by measuring nearly half of all extant primate species. The results clearly showed exceptional features of the human eye: (1) the exposed white sclera is void of any pigmentation, (2) humans possess the largest ratio of exposed sclera in the eye outline, and (3) the eye outline is extraordinarily elongated in the horizontal direction. The close correlation of the parameters reflecting (2) and (3) with habitat type or body size of the species examined suggested that these two features are adaptations for extending the visual field by eyeball movement, especially in the horizontal direction. Comparison of eye coloration and facial coloration around the eye suggested that the dark coloration of exposed sclera of nonhuman primates is an adaptation to camouflage the gaze direction against other individuals and/or predators, and that the white sclera of the human eye is an adaptation to enhance the gaze signal. The uniqueness of human eye morphology among primates illustrates the remarkable difference between human and other primates in the ability to communicate using gaze signals.},

  Abstract                 = {For soft tissue organs, standard 3D-reconstructions can only provide a snapshot of a dynamically deforming structure. A reasonable possibility to overcome this drawback is the transition forward from 3D-reconstruction to 4D-visualization, i. e. rendering time dependent behavior based on dynamical radiological data sets. This article is dedicated to dynamical visualization of craniofacial soft tissue, namely human eye movement (MRI) and real time visualization of the downward movement of a volunteer's mandible (256 row 4D-CT, NIRS, Chiba, Japan). Within several considered approaches for presentation of the results, stereoscopic realization of the 4D-visualization was regarded as providing best diagnostic impact and acceptance.}

  Abstract                 = {Forensic anthropology typically uses osteological and/or dental data either to estimate characteristics of unidentified individuals or to serve as evidence in cases where there is a putative identification. In the estimation context, the problem is to describe aspects of an individual that may lead to their eventual identification, whereas in the evidentiary context, the problem is to provide the relative support for the identification. In either context, individual characteristics such as sex and race may be useful. Using a previously published forensic case (Steadman et al. (2006) Am J Phys Anthropol 131:15-26) and a large (N = 3,167) reference sample, we show that the sex of the individual can be reliably estimated using a small set of 11 craniometric variables. The likelihood ratio from sex (assuming a 1:1 sex ratio for the ldquopopulation at largerdquo) is, however, relatively uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification. Similarly, the known ldquoracerdquo of the individual is relatively uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification, because the individual was recovered from an area where the 2000 US census provides a very homogenous picture of (self-identified) race. Of interest in this analysis is the fact that the individual, who was recovered from Eastern Iowa, classifies very clearly with [Howells 1973. Cranial Variation in Man: A Study by Multivariate Analysis of Patterns of Difference Among Recent Human Populations. Cambridge, MA: Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology; 1989. Skull Shape and the Map: Craniometric Analyses in the Dispersion of Modern Homo. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press]. Easter Islander sample in an analysis with uninformative priors. When the Iowa 2000 Census data on self-reported race are used for informative priors, the individual is clearly identified as ldquoAmerican White.rdquo This analysis shows the extreme importance of an informative prior in any forensic application.

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we both contend and illustrate that biological anthropologists, particularly in the Americas, often think like Bayesians but act like frequentists when it comes to analyzing a wide variety of data. In other words, while our research goals and perspectives are rooted in probabilistic thinking and rest on prior knowledge, we often proceed to use statistical hypothesis tests and confidence interval methods unrelated (or tenuously related) to the research questions of interest. We advocate for applying Bayesian analyses to a number of different bioanthropological questions, especially since many of the programming and computational challenges to doing so have been overcome in the past two decades. To facilitate such applications, this article explains Bayesian principles and concepts, and provides concrete examples of Bayesian computer simulations and statistics that address questions relevant to biological anthropology, focusing particularly on bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. It also simultaneously reviews the use of Bayesian methods and inference within the discipline to date. This article is intended to act as primer to Bayesian methods and inference in biological anthropology, explaining the relationships of various methods to likelihoods or probabilities and to classical statistical models. Our contention is not that traditional frequentist statistics should be rejected outright, but that there are many situations where biological anthropology is better served by taking a Bayesian approach. To this end it is hoped that the examples provided in this article will assist researchers in choosing from among the broad array of statistical methods currently available.

  Abstract                 = {SummaryIntroduction Orbital structures are affected in approximately 40% of all cases of craniofacial trauma. Changes in the bony orbital dimensions can alter the function of intraorbital contents and lead to serious complications. The unique anatomy of the orbit and the resulting surgical approaches make the process of fitting and aligning implants difficult, time consuming and operator dependent. It is now possible to make relatively inexpensive anatomical models on the basis of computed tomography images, using rapid prototyping. Such models can be used as templates to form titanium mesh implants, which are then used in the reconstruction of orbital floor defects.Material and methods Six patients with facial trauma were included in this study. First, 3D virtual models and then physical models were created. These were used as templates to shape the titanium mesh and then intraoperatively as guides to aid correct implant placement in the orbit.Results Significant improvement resulted in three cases and total recovery in three cases.Conclusion It is financially viable to build anatomical models, on the basis of CT studies, that can be used in the repair of orbital floor fractures.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Normal and abnormal jaw growth and tooth eruption are topics of great importance for several dental and medical disciplines. Thus far, clinical studies on these topics have used two-dimensional (2D) radiographic techniques. The purpose of the present study was to analyse normal mandibular growth and tooth eruption in three dimensions based on computer tomography (CT) scans, extending the principles of mandibular growth analysis proposed by Bj{\"o}rk in 1969 from two to three dimensions. As longitudinal CT data from normal children are not available (for ethical reasons), CT data from children with Apert syndrome were employed, because it has been shown that the mandible in Apert syndrome is unaffected by the malformation, and these children often have several craniofacial CT scans performed during childhood for planning of cranial and midface surgery and for follow-up after surgery. A total of 49 datasets from ten children with Apert syndrome were available for study. The number of datasets from each individual ranged from three to seven. The first CT scan in each of the ten series was carried out before 1 year of age, and the ages for the 49 scans ranged from 1 week to 14.5 years. The mandible and the teeth were segmented and iso-surfaces generated. Landmarks were placed on the surface of the mandible, along the mandibular canals, the inner contour of the cortical plate at the lower border of the symphysis menti, and on the teeth. Superimposition of the mandibles in the longitudinal series was performed using the symphysis menti and the mandibular canals as suggested by Bj{\"o}rk. The study supported the findings of stability of the symphysis menti and the mandibular canals as seen in profile view previously reported by Bj{\"o}rk & Skieller in 1983. However, the mandibular canals were, actually, relocated laterally during growth. Furthermore, the position of tooth buds remained relatively stable inside the jaw until root formation started. Eruption paths of canines and premolars were vertical, whereas molars erupted in a lingual direction. The 3D method would seem to offer new insight into jaw growth and tooth eruption, but further studies are needed.},

Is it possible to identify relationships between cranial morphology, gender and facial profile? Material and Methods: &nbsp;&nbsp;Profile photos of 110 adult patients were measured according to A.M. Schwarz landmarks using Onyx Ceph. Centroid size was calculated from x and y-coordinates. After Procrustes transformation, a principal component analysis for identifying major components of facial morphology was performed and the results visualized using thin-plate splines. At the same time, lateral cephalograms of all patients were analyzed according to Hasund. Results: &nbsp;&nbsp;There were significant differences in centroid size betweeen male and female patients. Only the vertical skeletal structure had an impact on centroid size. Six components (PC1 to PC6) were identified using PCA. They were responsible for 86.5% of the variance. PC1 (33.9%) described scaling along an axis from Porion to chin. PC2 (28.6%) characterized the vertical dimensions of the lower face. Significant differences were only apparent between males and females in PC3 and PC4. In terms of cephalometric parameters, PC2 and PC3 differed in the vertical, and PC1 und PC2 in the sagittal configuration. Conclusions: &nbsp;&nbsp;The analyses presented here suffice for describing facial morphology qualitatively and quantitatively as demonstrated by this example. Separating size from shape is useful for investigating therapeutically and growth-related morphological changes. It is difficult to draw conclusions about skeletal parameters.}

  Abstract                 = {In the past, improvements in craniofacial reconstructions (CFR) methodology languished due to the lack of adequate 3D databases that were sufficiently large and appropriate for 3-dimensional shape statistics. In our study, we created the FACE-R database from CT records and 3D surface scans of 400 clinical patients from Hungary, providing a significantly larger sample that was available before. The uniqueness of our database is linking of two data types that makes possible to investigate the bone and skin surface of the same individual, in upright position, thus eliminating many of the gravitational effects on the face during CT scanning. We performed a preliminary geometric morphometric (GMM) study using 3D data that produces a general idea of skull and face shape correlations. The vertical position of the tip of the (soft) nose for a skull and landmarks such as rhinion need to be taken into account. Likewise, the anterior nasal spine appears to exert some influence in this regard.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the Statismo framework, which is a framework for PCA based statistical models.Statistical models are used to describe the variability of an object within a population, learned from a set of training samples. Originally developed to model shapes, statistical models are now increasingly used to model the variation in different kind of data, such as for example images, volumetric meshes or deformation fields. Statismo has been developed with the following main goals in mind: 1) To provide generic tools for learning different kinds of PCA based statistical models, such as shape, appearance or deformations models. 2) To make the exchange of such models easier among different research groups and to improve the reproducibility of the models. 3) To allow for easy integration of new methods for model building into the framework. To achieve the first goal, we have abstracted all the aspects that are specific to a given model and data representation, into a user defined class. This does not only make it possible to use Statismo to create different kinds of PCA models, but also allows Statismo to be used with any toolkit and data format. To facilitate data exchange, Statismo defines a storage format based on HDF5, which includes all the information necessary to use the model, as well as meta-data about the model creation, which helps to make model building reproducible. The last goal is achieved by providing a clear separation between data management, model building and model representation. In addition to the standard method for building PCA models, Statismo already includes two recently proposed algorithms for building conditional models, as well as convenience tools for facilitating cross-validation studies. Although Statismo has been designed to be independent of a particular toolkit, special efforts have been made to make it directly useful for VTK and ITK. Besides supporting model building for most data representations used by VTK and ITK, it also provides an ITK transform class, which allows for the integration of Statismo with the ITK registration framework. This leverages the efforts from the ITK project to readily access powerful methods for model fitting.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. Classical multivariate analysis-of-variance tests perform poorly in cases with several highly correlated responses and the tests collapse when the number of responses exceeds the number of observations. This paper presents a new method which handles this problem. The dimensionality of the data is reduced by using principal component decompositions and the final tests are still based on the classical test statistics and their distributions. The methodology is illustrated with an example from the production of sausages with responses from near infra-red reflectance spectroscopy. A closely related method for testing relationships in uniresponse regression with collinear explanatory variables is also presented. The new test, which is called the 50-50 F-test, uses the first k components to calculate SS MODEL. The next d components are not involved in SS ERROR and they are called buffer components.},

Both categorical and continuous design variables are considered. To handle unbalanced data, we introduce the so-called Type II* sums of squares. This means that the results are independent of the scale chosen for continuous design variables. Furthermore, it does not matter whether two-level variables are coded as categorical or continuous. Overall testing of all responses is done by 50-50 MANOVA, which handles several highly correlated responses. Univariate p-values for each response are adjusted by using rotation testing. To illustrate multivariate effects, mean values and mean predictions are illustrated in a principal component score plot or directly as curves. For the unbalanced cases, we introduce a new variant of adjusted means, which are independent to the coding of two-level variables. The methodology is exemplified by case studies from cheese and fish pudding production.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this paper is to construct a mesh-model of a newborn skull for finite element analysis to study its deformation when subjected to the forces present during labour. The current state of medical imaging technology has reached a level which allows accurate visualisation and shape recovery of biological organs and body-parts. However, a sufficiently large set of medical images cannot always be obtained, often because of practical or ethical reasons, and the requirement to recover the shape of the biological object of interest has to be met by other means. Such is the case for a newborn skull. A method to recover the three-dimensional (3D) shape from (minimum) two orthogonal atlas images of the object of interest and a homologous object is described. This method is based on matching landmarks and curves on the orthogonal images of the object of interest with corresponding landmarks and curves on the homologous or 'master'-object which is fully defined in 3D space. On the basis of this set of corresponding landmarks, a thin-plate spline function can be derived to warp from the 'master'-object space to the 'slave'-object space. This method is applied to recover the 3D shape of a newborn skull. Images from orthogonal view-planes are obtained from an atlas. The homologous object is an adult skull, obtained from CT-images made available by the Visible Human Project. After shape recovery, a mesh-model of the newborn skull is generated.},

The aims of this study was to investigate the relationship between the hard and soft dimensions of the nose and to predict the position of nose using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans obtained from 60 adults. Three-dimensional placements of the nasal soft structures (pronasale, subnasale, ala) from the nasal hard structures (nasal bone, nasal cavity) were measured in order to compute the regression equations to find the most probable position of the pronasale, subnasale, and ala. The positions of the pronasale, subnasale, and ala can be predicted using the regression models. These results suggest that hard and soft tissue relation data from CBCT can be useful for predicting the position of nose.},

Three 3D computerized facial reconstructions were produced using skull models from live adult Korean subjects to assess facial morphology prediction accuracy. The 3D skeletal and facial data were recorded from the subjects in an upright position using a cone-beam CT scanner. Shell-to-shell deviation maps were created using 3D surface comparison software, and the deviation errors between the reconstructed and target faces were measured. Results showed that 54%, 65%, and 77% of the three facial reconstruction surfaces had <2.5 mm of error when compared to the relevant target face. The average error for each reconstruction was 0.46 mm (SD = 2.81) for A, 0.31 mm (SD= 2.40) for B, and 0.49 mm (SD = 2.16) for C. The facial features of the reconstructions demonstrated good levels of accuracy compared to the target faces.},

  Abstract                 = {For problems of classification and comparison in biological research, the primary focus is on the similarity of forms. A biological form can be conveniently defined as consisting of size and shape. Several approaches for comparing biological shapes using landmark data are available. Lele (1991a) critically discusses these approaches and proposes a new method based on the Euclidean distance matrix representation of the form of an object. The purpose of this paper is to extend this new methodology to the comparison of groups of objects. We develop the statistical versions of various concepts introduced by Lele (1991a) and use them for developing statistical procedures for testing the hypothesis of shape difference between biological forms. We illustrate the use of this method by studying morphological differences between normal children and those affected with Crouzon and Apert syndromes and craniofacial sexual dimorphism in Cebus apella.},

  Abstract                 = {Die Schnittbildverfahren CT und insbesondere MRT sind aus der modernen Orbitadiagnostik nicht mehr wegzudenken. Insbesondere der Einsatz von Oberfl{\"a}chenspulen hat die MRT zur Methode der Wahl bei nahezu allen Fragestellungen im Bereich der Orbita gemacht. Bei der Wertung der MRT f{\"u}r die Orbitadiagnostik sind zwei Bereiche zu trennen, n{\"a}mlich differentialdiagnostische {\"U}berlegungen und das Tumorstaging.   Patienten mit Ver{\"a}nderungen im Bereich der Orbita, die von einem Ophthalmologen zur MRT {\"u}berwiesen werden, haben h{\"a}ufig schon eine sonographische oder computertomographische Diagnostik durchlaufen, sodass die MRT zur Differentialdiagnose nur noch wenig beitragen muss. Durch die M{\"o}glichkeit der MRT, Schnittbilder in allen Raumebenen anzufertigen, ist die Zuordnung von orbitalen Prozessen zu einem Orbitakompartiment und damit die differentialdiagnostische Einordnung erheblich leichter und genauer als bei der transversalen CT. So ist z. B. die Zuordnung eines vergr{\"o}{\ss}erten M. rectus inferior im transversalen CT-Bild erheblich schwerer als im koronaren MRT-Bild. Die MRT ist gegen{\"u}ber der CT dar{\"u}ber hinaus im Vorteil, weil durch den h{\"o}heren Weichteilkontrast Gewebeinformationen verf{\"u}gbar sind, die eine Differenzierung verschiedener Pathologien erlaubt. Lediglich beim Nachweis von Kalk ist die CT der MRT {\"u}berlegen, was beispielsweise bei Ver{\"a}nderungen des Sehnervs (Optikusscheidenmeningeom) wegweisend sein kann. Besonders hervorzuheben f{\"u}r die Bedeutung der MRT ist die Diagnostik der endokrinen Orbitopathie: Hier ist die MRT in der Lage, durch Messung bzw. Berechnung quantitativer Parameter eine Aussage {\"u}ber den Akuit{\"a}tsgrad der Erkrankung abzugeben, was direkte Auswirkungen auf das therapeutische Procedere hat. Auf der anderen Seite ist bei einem bekannten Tumor das Tumorstaging vor Beginn einer Therapie von entscheidender Bedeutung, so z. B. bei pr{\"a}septalen Tumoren, Bulbustumoren, aber auch s{\"a}mtlichen retrobulb{\"a}ren Tumoren. Die MRT erm{\"o}glicht hier eine Weichteildifferenzierung, wie sie mit der CT nicht und mit der Sonographie nur zum Teil erreicht wird. Erst im Bereich der Orbitaspitze und bei kn{\"o}chernen Ver{\"a}nderungen ist die CT der MRT meist {\"u}berlegen.g},

Fluctuating asymmetry stress relations are real but are typically weak and difficult to detect. Researchers would like to maximize the probability of detecting FA?stress relations when they exist. We assert that analyses based on the FA of multiple traits may provide better methods for detecting stress. In this article, we used computer simulations to compare the ability of six analyses to detect differences in FA between stressed and unstressed populations. We show that the optimal analysis depends upon the underlying form of the FA distributions. We also show that two of the analyses had inflated Type I errors in some situations. Finally, we quantify the advantage of our preferred analysis over those of single trait FA in detecting stress.},

Patients and Methods Eight patients who underwent open reduction and fixation for a ZMC injury with orbital volume change were studied. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the zygomaticomaxillary area was performed before the operation in each case. Scanned data were converted into 3D models using Mimics software (Materialise, Brussels, Belgium) for surgical designs. Virtual surgical reductions and correlated guiding templates were designed using Mimics and Magics software (Materialise). The operations were performed with the help of prefabricated templates to reduce the fractures. A postoperative CT scan of each patient was obtained within 2 weeks after surgery, and quantitative measurements were made to assess the surgical outcomes. Preoperative volumes of the bilateral orbits were compared, and concordance with postoperative volumes of the bilateral orbits was assessed. Twenty-one pairs of distances from 7 marker points to 3 reference planes were measured to assess postoperative facial symmetry. Results Volumes of the injured orbits were significantly different from volumes of the uninjured orbits preoperatively (.05), whereas bilateral orbital volumes showed no statistically significant difference postoperatively (.05). In addition, 19 of the 21 pairs of bilateral distances showed no significant difference postoperatively (.05). Conclusions Quantitative assessment showed that digitally designed, rapid-prototyping templates for ZMC fractures have a positive impact on restoring facial symmetry and concordance of bilateral orbital volumes.},

Here we report on a new cranium from Dmanisi (D4500) that, together with its mandible (D2600), represents the world's first completely preserved adult hominid skull from the early Pleistocene. D4500/D2600 combines a small braincase (546 cubic centimeters) with a large prognathic face and exhibits close morphological affinities with the earliest known Homo fossils from Africa. The Dmanisi sample, which now comprises five crania, provides direct evidence for wide morphological variation within and among early Homo paleodemes. This implies the existence of a single evolving lineage of early Homo, with phylogeographic continuity across continents.},

Abstracts that appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria were selected by consensus. The original articles were then retrieved and their references hand-searched for possible missing articles.Results A total of 8 articles met the selection criteria. Differences between the magnitudes of errors of landmarks and their associated measurements were discussed.Conclusions It was concluded that each landmark exhibited a characteristic pattern of error that contributed to measurement inaccuracy, and with repeated practice of landmark identifications, the error can be reduced to within 0.5 mm for 2-D CT. Considerations have to be given to some of the 3-D CT reliability values because they can have diagnosis implications.}

  Abstract                 = {The existence of additive genetic variance in developmental stability has important implications for our understanding of morphological variation. The heritability of individual fluctuating asymmetry and other measures of developmental stability have frequently been estimated from parent-offspring regressions, sib analyses, or from selection experiments. Here we review by meta-analysis published estimates of the heritability of developmental stability, mainly the degree of individual fluctuating asymmetry in morphological characters. The overall mean effect size of heritabilities of individual fluctuating asymmetry was 0.19 from 34 studies of 17 species differing highly significantly from zero (P < 0.0001). The mean heritability for 14 species was 0.27. This indicates that there is a significant additive genetic component to developmental stability. Effect size was larger for selection experiments than for studies based on parent-offspring regression or sib analyses, implying that genetic estimates were unbiased by maternal or common environment effects. Additive genetic coefficients of variation for individual fluctuating asymmetry were considerably higher than those for character size per se. Developmental stability may be significantly heritable either because of strong directional selection, or fluctuating selection regimes which prevent populations from achieving a high degree of developmental stability to current environmental and genetic conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {CT scanning and MR imaging of the eye and orbit have significantly enhanced the diagnosis of ocular and orbital lesions [1-21]. The anatomy and pathologic findings of the bony orbit, surrounding structures of the eye, and optic pathways can now be visualized with exquisite detail, so that the diagnosis of pathologic conditions can be made with much more certainty than in the past [1-21]. The evolution of advanced technologies has greatly influenced and aided in the differentiation of orbital and ocular lesions. Oplithalmologic diagnostic evaluation, in particular, has significantly improved with the use of imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MR imaging. The increasing availability of clinical highfield MR imaging at 3 Tesla (3-T) scanners holds the promise of making 3-T MR imaging scanners more available for routine clinical use. The purpose of this article is to describe the application of the 3-T MR imaging scanner in orbital and ocular pathologic findings and, in particular, whether the 3-T MR imaging scanner improves the imaging evaluation of orbital and ocular lesions. In keeping with the purpose of this issue, we review the MR imaging characteristics of selected patients (Table 1) who presented with various orbital and ocular disorders and underwent scanning on a 3-T MR imaging scanner. Some of these patients also underwent scanning on a 1.5-T MR imaging unit. An attempt is made to emphasize the diagnostic patterns of common orbital and ocular lesions on 3-T MR imaging sequences.},

A sample of 86 lateral head cephalograms of adult subjects from Central Europe was measured, and the actual and predicted dimensions were compared. Regarding nose projection (the anterior and vertical position of the pronasale), in general, the method of Rynn et al. (Forensic Sci Med Pathol 6, 2010, 20) was found to perform better and with less error variance than the method of Stephan et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 122, 2003, 240), but the mean difference between the actual and predicted values did not exceed 2.2{\^A} mm (6.5% of the actual dimension) in most of the variables tested. The vertical dimensions of the nose were predictable with greater accuracy than the horizontal dimensions. Although the mean error of both methods is not great in practice and thus both methods could be considered to be "accurate" the real variance of error should not be overlooked.},

Various properties of the paried shape distribution are investigated, and some special cases given. This work is a natural progression of what has been done on only univariate' shape analysis. However, one of the fundamental biological applications in shape analysis is in analysing shape change, and this work offers a possible solution. We illustrate our method by examining shape change in rat calvaria.},

  Abstract                 = {Multivariate Calibration Harald Martens, Chemist, Norwegian Food Research Institute, Aas, Norway and Norwegian Computing Center, Oslo, Norway Tormod N?s, Statistician, Norwegian Food Research Institute, Aas, Norway The aim of this inter-disciplinary book is to present an up-to-date view of multivariate calibration of analytical instruments, for use in research, development and routine laboratory and process operation. The book is intended to show practitioners in chemistry and technology how to extract the quantitative and understandable information embedded in non-selective, overwhelming and apparently useless measurements by multivariate data analysis. Multivariate calibration is the process of learning how to combine data from several channels, in order to overcome selectivity problems, gain new insight and allow automatic outlier detection. Multivariate calibration is the basis for the present success of high-speed {Near-Infrared} {(NIR)} diffuse spectroscopy of intact samples. But the technique is very general: it has shown similar advantages in, for instance, {UV}, Vis, and {IR} spectrophotometry, (transmittance, reflectance and fluorescence), for x-ray diffraction, {NMR}, {MS}, thermal analysis, chromatography {(GC}, {HPLC)} and for electrophoresis and image analysis (tomography, microscopy), as well as other techniques. The book is written at two levels: the main level is structured as a tutorial on the practical use of multivariate calibration techniques. It is intended for university courses and self-study for chemists and technologists, giving one complete and versatile approach, based mainly on data compression methodology in self-modelling {PLS} regression, with considerations of experimental design, data pre-processing and model validation. A second, more methodological, level is intended for statisticians and specialists in chemometrics. It compares several alternative calibration methods, validation approaches and ways to optimize the models. The book also outlines some cognitive changes needed in analytical chemistry, and suggests ways to overcome some communication problems between statistics and chemistry and technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research on the visual system has focused on investigating the relationship among eye (ocular), orbital, and visual cortical anatomy in humans. This issue is relevant in evolutionary and medical fields. In terms of evolution, only in modern humans and Neandertals are the orbits positioned beneath the frontal lobes, with consequent structural constraints. In terms of medicine, such constraints can be associated with minor deformation of the eye, vision defects, and patterns of integration among these features, and in association with the frontal lobes, are important to consider in reconstructive surgery. Further study is therefore necessary to establish how these variables are related, and to what extent ocular size is associated with orbital and cerebral cortical volumes. Relationships among these anatomical components were investigated using magnetic resonance images from a large sample of 83 individuals, which also included each subject's body height, age, sex, and uncorrected visual acuity score. Occipital and frontal gyri volumes were calculated using two different cortical parcellation tools in order to provide a better understanding of how the eye and orbit vary in relation to visual cortical gyri, and frontal cortical gyri which are not directly related to visual processing. Results indicated that ocular and orbital volumes were weakly correlated, and that eye volume explains only a small proportion of the variance in orbital volume. Ocular and orbital volumes were also found to be equally and, in most cases, more highly correlated with five frontal lobe gyri than with occipital lobe gyri associated with V1, V2, and V3 of the visual cortex. Additionally, after accounting for age and sex variation, the relationship between ocular and total visual cortical volume was no longer statistically significant, but remained significantly related to total frontal lobe volume. The relationship between orbital and visual cortical volumes remained significant for a number of occipital lobe gyri even after accounting for these cofactors, but was again found to be more highly correlated with the frontal cortex than with the occipital cortex. These results indicate that eye volume explains only a small amount of variation in orbital and visual cortical volume, and that the eye and orbit are generally more structurally associated with the frontal lobes than they are functionally associated with the visual cortex of the occipital lobes. Results also demonstrate that these components of the visual system are highly complex and influenced by a multitude of factors in humans.},

  Abstract                 = {The principal aim of this research is to provide a new model for investigating myopia in humans, and contribute to an understanding of the degree to which modern variation and evolutionary change in orbital and overall craniofacial morphology may help explain the common eye form association with this condition. Recent research into long and short-term evolution of the human orbit reveals a number of changes in this feature, and particularly since the Upper Paleolithic. These include a reduction in orbital depth, a decrease in anterior projection of the upper and lower orbital margins, and most notably, a reduction in orbital volume since the Holocene in East Asia. Reduced orbital volume in this geographic region could exacerbate an existing trend in recent hominin evolution toward larger eyes in smaller orbits, and may help explain the unusually high frequency of myopia in East Asian populations. The objective of the current study is to test a null hypothesis of no relationship between a ratio of orbit to eye volume and spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) in a sample of Chinese adults, and examine how relative size of the eye within the orbit relates to SER between the sexes and across the sample population.},

In this work, we investigate the benefits of region ensembles for statistical learning based 3D face <span class='snippet'>recognition</span>. This investigation is conducted using 3D Fisherfaces and demonstrates that region ensembles improve the ability of the Fisherface approach to create discriminating features, even for untrained subject samples. In fact, comparable performance can be achieved using significantly fewer training subjects. In addition, gallery score normalization is integrated into the region ensemble framework and is shown to improve performance over a single normalization of the ensemble match score. Performance improvement is particularly evident at low false alarm rates. An All versus All comparison of the FRGC 2.0 database obtains a 97.1% True Accept Rate (TAR) at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) when the approach is trained with 100 subjects and improves to 98.1% with integrated gallery score normalization.},

  Abstract                 = {This study was conducted to re-examine the osteological anatomy of the orbit. Previous studies examined dried human skulls; this study looks at cadaveric specimens in a population that more closely resembles the population in the United States. Measurements were made of the bony orbit to define safe distances for surgical intervention and to identify distances to intraorbital fissures, canals, and foramina. Safe distances to the optic nerve were identified by subtracting 5 mm from the shortest measured specimen. The safe distances were as follows: medial quadrant, 29 mm; inferior quadrant, 39 mm; superior quadrant, 38 mm; and lateral quadrant, 36 mm. Staying close to the bony wall, not exceeding these parameters, and careful identification of anatomical structures should keep the surgeon from inadvertent damage to the intraorbital structures.},

Strong associations between blue/brown eye colour and the SNP loci rs1129038 and rs12913832 in the HERC2 gene were recently described. Weaker associations between eye colour and other genetic markers also exist. In 395 randomly selected Danes, we investigated the predictive values of various combinations of SNP alleles in the HERC2, OCA2 and MATP (SLC45A2) genes and compared the results to the eye colours as they were described by the individuals themselves. The highest predictive value of typing either the HERC2 SNPs rs1129038 and/or rs12913832 that are in strong linkage disequilibrium was observed when eye colour was divided into two groups, (1) blue, grey and green (light) and (2) brown and hazel (dark). Sequence variations in rs11636232 and rs7170852 in HERC2, rs1800407 in OCA2 and rs16891982 in MATP showed additional association with eye colours in addition to the effect of HERC2 rs1129038. Diplotype analysis of three sequence variations in HERC2 and one sequence variation in OCA2 showed the best discrimination between light and dark eye colours with a likelihood ratio of 29.3.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Manual segmentation of CT datasets for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation is a time-consuming procedure. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated segmentation procedure for the facial skeleton based on a virtual anatomic atlas of the skull, to test its practicability, and to evaluate the accuracy of the segmented objects.

Materials and methods The atlas skull was created by manually segmenting an unaffected skull CT dataset. For automated segmentation of cases via IPlan cranial (BrainLAB, Germany), the atlas skull underwent projection, controlled deformation, and a facultative threshold segmentation within the individual datasets, of which 16 routine CT (13 pathologies, 3 without) were processed. The variations of the no-threshold versus threshold segmentation results compared to the original were determined. The clinical usability of the results was assessed in a multicentre evaluation.

Results Compared to the original dataset, the mean accuracy was _<0.6 mm for the threshold segmentation and 0.6-1.4 mm for the no-threshold segmentation. Comparing both methods together, the deviation was _<0.2 mm. An isolated no-threshold segmentation of the orbital cavity alone resulted in a mean accuracy of _<0.6 mm. With regard to clinical usability, the no-threshold method was clearly preferred, reaching modal scores of "good" to "moderate" in most areas. Limitations were seen in segmenting the TMJ, mandibular fractures, and thin bone in general.

Conclusion The feasibility of automated skull segmentation was demonstrated. The virtual anatomic atlas can improve the preprocessing of skull CT scans for computer assisted craniomaxillofacial surgery planning.},

A database of 279 CT scans of Caucasian patients without traumatic deformation of the midface was analysed. 3D-image segmentation of the midfacial skeleton was performed using a computer-assisted protocol. A virtual plane (50 mm2) was constructed using defined landmarks above the orbital floor. An automated procedure was used to measure the distance between the orbital floor and the constructed plane at 400 distinct points. A mathematical algorithm was used to analyse the data, and to calculate a map of the orbital floor. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that orbital floor topography could be classified as distinct clusters. There were 12 variations of orbital floor anatomy: three unique patterns of the orbital floor for the right orbit and three corresponding patterns for the left side, all of which varied between the sexes. The 12 patterns were constructed with a statistical confidence interval of 1.36 ± 0.6 mm.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective Computer-aided surgery (CAS) has proved to be useful in reconstructive craniomaxillofacial surgery. Preoperative creation of virtual models by segmentation of the computerized tomography (CT) dataset and mirroring of the unaffected side allows for precise planning of complex reconstructive procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the preoperative planning and the postoperative result regarding the skeletal reconstruction. Study design In a first step, the symmetry of unaffected human skulls and faces were evaluated by 20 midface CT data of skulls and 20 surface-scan data of healthy individuals. By mirroring and adjusting the original and mirrored datasets using a 3-dimensional modeling software, an automatic measurement procedure could evaluate the mean and the maximal modulus of the distances between both datasets. In a second step, 18 consecutive cases were selected which had been treated with CAS support. Group 1 consisted of orbital floor and/or medial wall fractures (n = 12), group 2 consisted of zygomatic bone fractures (n = 4), and group 3 included 2 patients who were treated by secondary orbital reconstruction including reosteotomy of the zygomatic bone (n = 2). To verify the surgical result, the preoperative CT dataset including the virtual planning and the postoperative CT dataset were compared by using image fusion. Additionally, postoperative surface scans and the clinical symptoms of the patients were evaluated. Results No differences between the skull and face symmetry were found. Mean values for distances considering the skull symmetry were 0.83 mm for male and 0.71 mm for female and for the face symmetry 0.65 mm for male and 0.76 mm for female. Comparing the preoperative planning with the postoperative outcome, a mean accuracy of 1.49-4.12 mm with maximum modulus of 2.49-6.00 mm was achieved. Orbital true-to-original reconstructions and the secondary reconstructions were more precise than the reposition of the zygomatic bones. The postoperative acquired surface scans resulted in mean distances from 0.89 to 1.784 mm. Despite these deviations, all patients demonstrated satisfying clinical outcome. Conclusion The natural asymmetry in humans influences the accuracy of preoperative planning procedure, when the mirroring tool is used. The accuracy transforming the preoperative planning to the surgical reconstruction using CAS depends on location, surgical approach, and matter of reconstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives The aim of this investigation was to develop and test the accuracy of a procedure for fabricating individual preformed titanium meshes for orbital fractures. Study design Preoperative CT datasets from five patients with orbital fractures were used for 3D reconstruction by mirroring the unaffected side onto the defective one, resulting in a new sub-volume. A template for adaptation of the titanium mesh was produced by applying these sub-volumes. Navigation-aided procedures guaranteed the exact placement of the preformed mesh during the operation. Results The accuracy of the reconstructed orbital floor was determined to be approximately 1 mm, which lies within the technical limit of detection. Conclusion These results indicate a further application or navigation-aided reconstruction, which will serve as a pilot project for further investigations. Clustered databases of patients will be used to produce various template sets, reflecting ideal skeletons, according to age, sex, and other patient variables. These could be used for manufacturing preformed osteosynthesis templates.},

The overall performance of the estimators is compared in terms of their bias, variance and squared error. The results indicate that the 0.632 estimate and leave-one-out cross-validation are preferable when one can afford the computation. Otherwise adjusted 5- or 10-fold cross-validation are good candidates because of their computational efficiency. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Results presented call into question differences in mandible shape recently used to distinguish Gigantopithecus giganteus from Gigantopithecus blacki and to justify resurrecting a different generic designation, "Indopithecus," for the former. It is concluded that while the two large-bodied Asian taxa may have been adapted to slightly different dietary niches with different geographic and temporal ranges, the unique mandibular/dental characters that the two taxa share should not be viewed as independent evolutionary developments.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a multivariate classification technique frequently applied to morphometric data in various biomedical disciplines. Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors.},

  Abstract                 = {Geometric morphometrics is the statistical analysis of form based on Cartesian landmark coordinates. After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features.},

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes.},

Study Design The periorbital asymmetry of 35 patients with medium-sized orbital floor fractures that were surgically treated with alloplastic resorbable implants was evaluated and compared with that of a healthy control group using an optical 3-dimensional facial scanner. Distance measurements between facial surface landmarks, as well as volume measurements between the original image and an automatically generated mirror image, were performed using commercially available software. Results There were no statistically significant differences in the distance measurements (.05) and volume measurements ( .05) within the groups or when the study group and control group were compared using the Student t test. Conclusions Alloplastic resorbable implants can restore medium defects of the orbital floor without significant periorbital asymmetry. Automatically constructed mirror images can be a helpful tool for detecting asymmetries in faces.},

The differential expression of these characteristics is described almost identically in the relevant literature. The descriptions date back to the 18th century and stem from observations of inhomogenous investigations, partly with very small samples. Therefore, it is necessary to re-assess the significance of each characteristic. The objective of the present study is to determine the significance that can be attributed to different morphological characteristics and metric data of the os zygomaticum used in sex diagnostics from a current point of view. A collection of 138 recent human skulls was investigated. Both examination of the morphological characteristics as well as metric analysis of the cheekbone in the test group revealed that both methods were suitable for differentiating sex, but due to their variability they cannot be regarded as sufficiently reliable.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate craniofacial asymmetry by using 2-dimensional (2D) posteroanterior cephalometric images, 3-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and physical measurements (gold standard). Methods Ten dry human skulls were assessed, and radiopaque markers were placed on 17 skeletal landmarks. Twenty linear measurements were taken on each side to compare the right and left sides and to compare these measurements with the physical measurements made with a digital caliper. To acquire the 2D posteroanterior radiographs, an Extraoral Phosphor Storage Plate (Air Techniques, Chicago, Ill) was used as the image receptor with a Eureka x-ray-Duocon Machlett unit (Machlett Laboratores, Chicago, Ill). Three-dimensional imaging data were acquired from a CB MercuRay (Hitachi Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Results On average, the right side was larger than the left for most of the 20 distances evaluated in the digital 2D and the CBCT images, and there was poor agreement between the digital 2D images and the physical measurements (kappa{\^A} = 0.0609) and almost perfect agreement (kappa{\^A} = 0.92) between the CBCT and physical measurements when individual measurements were considered. Conclusions Human skulls, with no apparent asymmetry, had some differences between the right and left sides, with dominance for the right side but with no clinical significance. CBCT can better evaluate craniofacial morphology when compared with digital 2D images.},

A {3-D} elastic matching algorithm has been developed to use surface information for registering volumes. Surface extraction is performed in two steps: extraction of contours in {2-D} image planes using active contours, and forming triangular patch surface models from the stack of {2-D} contours. One volume is modeled as being deformed with respect to another goal volume. Correspondences between surfaces in the two image volumes are used to warp the deformed volume towards its goal. This process of contour extraction, surface formation and matching, and warping is repeated a number of times, with decreasing image volume stiffness. As the iterations continue the stretched volume is refined towards its goal volume. Registration examples of deformed volumes are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently developed methods for power analysis expand the options available for study design. We demonstrate how easily the methods can be applied by (1) reviewing their formulation and (2) describing their application in the preparation of a particular grant proposal. The focus is a complex but ubiquitous setting: repeated measures in a longitudinal study. Describing the development of the research proposal allows demonstrating the steps needed to conduct an effective power analysis. Discussion of the example also highlights issues that typically must be considered in designing a study. First, we discuss the motivation for using detailed power calculations, focusing on multivariate methods in particular. Second, we survey available methods for the general linear multivariate model (GLMM) with Gaussian errors and recommend those based on F approximations. The treatment includes coverage of the multivariate and univariate approaches to repeated measures, MANOVA, ANOVA, multivariate regression, and univariate regression. Third, we describe the design of the power analysis for the example, a longitudinal study of a child's intellectual performance as a function of mother's estimated verbal intelligence. Fourth, we present the results of the power calculations. Fifth, we evaluate the tradeoffs in using reduced designs and tests to simplify power calculations. Finally, we discuss the benefits and costs of power analysis in the practice of statistics. We make three recommendations: 1. Align the design and hypothesis of the power analysis with the planned data analysis, as best as practical. 2. Embed any power analysis in a defensible sensitivity analysis. 3. Have the extent of the power analysis reflect the ethical, scientific, and monetary costs. We conclude that power analysis catalyzes the interaction of statisticians and subject matter specialists. Using the recent advances for power analysis in linear models can further invigorate the interaction.},

Closed form, finite series expressions do not exist for the distribution functions in either the null or non-null case (except for special cases). In practice, asymptotic approximations, based on F or chi square distributions, are used for the null case. It is not widely known that similarly accurate and general approximations have been published for the non-null case, for all except the largest root [15,38]. In this paper new approximations, based on noncentral F's, are provided for power for all but the largest root. These generalize existing F approximations for the central case. Much less calculation is needed than for earlier approximations and accuracy appears not to suffer in practice. An upper bound F approximation is provided for the largest root power. Power calculation can be used to help choose a test statistic as well as for experimental design. A particularly convenient method for estimating power, using standard linear models programs [20], is generalized to the multivariate case.},

The four most easily localized anthropometric (soft tissue) landmarks for the sagittal orbital-globe relationship are orbitale superius (os), orbitale inferius (oi), orbitale laterale (ol), and nasion (n), all referenced to apex corneae (acor). The normal adult values for os, oi, ol, and n were extracted from the literature. Age-specific anthropometric landmarks were computed from age-specific Bolton cephalometric templates. A vernier caliper was used to measure preoperatively the surface orbital landmarks in patients with various syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostotic disorders. Preoperative measurements were compared with the derived normative data to determine the necessary sagittal orbital translocation for frontal advancement (n=19) and frontal-midfacial advancement (n=2). Postoperative orbital anthropometry documented the degree of normalization of the sagittal orbital-globe relationship. The problems with current instrumentation for orbital anthropometry are discussed. FAU - Mulliken, J B},

In this study, the accuracy and reliability of recording forensic information from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of the jaws when compared to conventional panoramic radiographs has been analyzed under experimental conditions. Information could be recorded with near-perfect repeatability and reproducibility. Information could also be recorded accurately, the sensitivity being 96.6% and specificity being 98.4% . The metal dental restoration induced streak artifact was at a level that permitted, in most cases, accurate observations. This is considered an important step in validating CBCT as a tool in comparative dental identification of bodies. It may have a role in mass fatalities and in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents, but further studies are required to assess the feasibility of this.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors present the clinical results of their method of customized reconstruction of orbital wall defects using titanium mesh or sheet. High resolution computed tomography (CT) data are imported and processed to create a three-dimensional (3D) image which is used to reconstruct the orbital defect. Mirror imaging of the air in the contralateral maxillary sinus is used to overcome artefact defects in the floor. A stereolithographic model is constructed, from which titanium mesh or sheet is shaped and sized to the required contours for implantation. Twenty-two patients were treated using this technique from 2003 to 2008. Postoperatively 10 patients reported early resolution of their diplopia. Six patients noticed significant improvement of their symptoms with mild residual diplopia in one direction only and at the extremes of gaze at final review. One patient required ocular muscle surgery. Enophthalmos resolved in eight of the nine cases. No patients developed enophthalmos or diplopia as a postoperative complication. The use of titanium mesh for orbital floor reconstruction has been shown to be safe and effective. Customized titanium implants accurately reproduce orbital contours thus restoring orbital volume. This reduces operative time and improves the functional and aesthetic outcomes of post-traumatic orbital reconstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {Facial reconstruction has been widely criticised for its subjective nature and is thus often viewed as a last resort. Recent computer-aided reconstructions, which claim to be objective, may be subject to similar errors. To date, both manual reconstructions and computer-aided techniques have been limited to using the same tissue depth data reference tables. We propose that it is not solely the accuracy of the soft tissue depth data, but the sparsity of landmarks, which contributes to a lack of understanding of how soft tissue changes between the landmarks. The authors feel that a new approach to facial reconstruction using a computer graphics technique known as volume deformation addresses some of the problems encountered in the past. A review of previous methods is provided with discussion of the strengths and limitations of these techniques. In addition, areas are highlighted where the new deformation-based approach may offer possible solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Human mandibular morphology is often thought to reflect mainly function, and to be of lesser value in studies of population history. Previous descriptions of human mandibles showed variation in ramal height and breadth to be the strongest difference among recent human groups. Several mandibular traits that differentiate Neanderthals from modern humans include greater robusticity, a receding symphysis, a large retromolar space, a rounder gonial area, an asymmetric mandibular notch, and a posteriorly positioned mental foramen in Neanderthals. Nevertheless, the degree to which these differences are part of modern human variation and/or are related to size and function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to document geographic and functional patterning in the mandibular shape of recent humans, to assess the effects of allometry on mandibular form, and to quantitatively evaluate proposed "Neanderthal" mandibular traits through comparison with samples of geographically diverse recent humans. Data were collected in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of 28 landmarks. Unlike previous studies, this analysis found that modern human mandibular shape exhibits considerable geographic patterning, with some aspects of mandibular morphology reflecting a climatic gradient, and others, a functional specialization. Population history is also reflected in mandibular form, albeit relatively weakly. Proposed "Neanderthal" traits were found to separate Neanderthal from modern human mandibles successfully in the statistical analysis. Of these, the retromolar gap was found to be related to increased mandibular size in modern humans. The status of this trait as a Neanderthal autapomorphy should therefore be treated with caution.},

Form comparison of 3D anthropometric data can make up the deficiency of traditional methods. In this paper, methods for analyzing 3D other than 2D objects are highlighted. We summarize the advance of form comparison techniques in the last decades. According to whether they are based upon anatomical landmarks, we partition them into two main categories, landmark-based methods and landmark-free methods. The former methods are further sub-divided into deformation methods, superimposition methods, and methods based on linear distances, while the latter methods are sub-divided into shape statistics-based methods, methods based on function analysis, view-based methods, topology-based methods, and hybrid methods. Examples for each method are presented. The discussion about their advantages and disadvantages are also introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The nasal cavity is essential for humidifying and warming the air before it reaches the sensitive lungs. Because humans inhabit environments that can be seen as extreme from the perspective of respiratory function, nasal cavity shape is expected to show climatic adaptation. This study examines the relationship between modern human variation in the morphology of the nasal cavity and the climatic factors of temperature and vapor pressure, and tests the hypothesis that within increasingly demanding environments (colder and drier), nasal cavities will show features that enhance turbulence and air-wall contact to improve conditioning of the air. We use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods and multivariate statistics to model and analyze the shape of the bony nasal cavity of 10 modern human population samples from five climatic groups. We report significant correlations between nasal cavity shape and climatic variables of both temperature and humidity. Variation in nasal cavity shape is correlated with a cline from cold-dry climates to hot-humid climates, with a separate temperature and vapor pressure effect. The bony nasal cavity appears mostly associated with temperature, and the nasopharynx with humidity. The observed climate-related shape changes are functionally consistent with an increase in contact between air and mucosal tissue in cold-dry climates through greater turbulence during inspiration and a higher surface-to-volume ratio in the upper nasal cavity.

Flexure of the mandibular ramus is one of these traits, and various researchers found widely differing results using this morphological feature. The aim of this study was to determine whether differences between male and female mandibular rami could be observed using the computerized method of geometric morphometrics, a valuable tool that helps quantify shape differences. Twenty-eight mandibular rami of black females and 43 of black males were photographed in a standard plane and assessed. It was found that the females were more scattered on the graph (more variable in shape), while the males clustered more around the center point where the two axes met (shape more constant). There was, however, considerable overlap between the sexes. Although different tendencies exist between the rami of males (being more flexed) and females (tending to be straight), the extent of these differences is not adequate to predict the sex of a single individual.},

Birth years of the individuals ranged from 1926 to 1979, and age at death was over 19 years for all individuals. A total of 10 anthropological measurements were used in the discriminant function analysis: maximum cranial length, cranial base length, maximum cranial breadth, maximum frontal breadth, basion-bregmatic height, upper facial breadth, bizygomatic breadth, bicondylar breadth, bigonial breadth, and ramal height. As a result, nine discriminant functions were established. The classification accuracy ranged from 79.0 to 89.9% when the measurements of the 113 individuals were substituted into the established functions, from 77.8 to 88.1% when a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was applied to the data, and from 86.7 to 93.0% when the measurements of 50 new individuals (25 males and 25 females), unrelated to the establishment of the discriminant functions, were used.},

  Abstract                 = {American forensicanthropologists uncritically accepted the biological race concept from classic physical anthropology and applied it to methods of human identification. Why and how the biological race concept might work in forensic anthropology was contemplated by Sauer (Soc Sci Med 34 107-111), who hypothesized that American forensic anthropologists are good at what they do because of a concordance between social race and skeletal morphology in American whites and blacks. However, Sauer also stressed that this concordance did not validate the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology that there are a relatively small number of discrete types of human beings. Results from Howells (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 67 1-259; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 79 1-189; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 82 1-108) and others using craniometric and molecular data show strong geographic patterning of human variation despite overlap in their distributions. However, Williams et al. (Curr Anthropol 46 340-346) concluded that skeletal morphology cannot be used to accurately classify individuals. Williams et al. cited additional support from Lewontin (Evol Biol 6 381-398), who analyzed classic genetic markers. In this study, multivariate analyses of craniometric data support Sauer's hypothesis that there are morphological differences between American whites and blacks. We also confirm significant geographic patterning in human variation but also find differences among groups within continents. As a result, if biological races are defined by uniqueness, then there are a very large number of biological races that can be defined, contradicting the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology. Further, our results show that humans can be accurately classified into geographic origin using craniometrics even though there is overlap among groups.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An increasing infiltration of creationism into Life Sciences has been noticeable recently, especially in the disclaiming of mutation and natural selection as pushing factors in Evolution. Using a very idiosyncratic argumentation, Human Evolution is depicted as an implausible hypothesis. Now a German State minister for education is even demanding the inclusion of creationism into discussion within the school subject of biology. Anthropology can help to support teachers in their efforts of teaching biological facts, problems and unanswered questions in human evolution. Thus, we decided to prepare a course designed to support schools in the Freiburg area in their responsibility to teach the theory of evolution. A graduate student research project was therefore installed to develop this course. Classes may visit the Anthropological Institute and participate in a workshop. Based on a substantial collection of key fossil casts covering human evolution, they will receive professional guidance paired with interactive modules. Additional materials for teachers are also available. The programme starts after summer school break 2009. This is our contribution to the Darwin Year.},

Advances in laser scanning technology allow fast and accurate capture of bone surface morphology. However, methodologies to utilise these new accurate 3D data have not been fully developed. The present study uses canonical sampling of whole surface morphology attained through laser scanning and for the first time applies the technique to analysis of bone morphology. We introduce a new technique for identifying allometric shape characters in whole bone surface morphology. In a sample of adult human astragalus the new technique is successful in identifying and isolating intra-specific allometric shape characters in a bone which typically lacks landmarks and has, consequently, proved difficult to analyse using traditional 3D morphometric methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to warp three-dimensional (3D) meshes from known biological morphology to fit other known, predicted or hypothetical morphologies has a range of potential applications in functional morphology and biomechanics. One of the most challenging of these applications is Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible. Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model. We further present new statistical approaches, strain frequency plots and landmark point strains, to analyse FEA results quantitatively and further integrate FEA with geometric morphometrics. Using strain frequency plots, strain field, bending displacements and landmark point strain data we demonstrate that the mechanical behaviour of warped specimens reproduces that of targets without significant error. The influence of including internal cavity morphology in FEA models was also examined and shown to increase bending displacements and strain magnitudes in FE models. The warping approaches presented here will be useful in a range of applications including the generation and analysis of virtual reconstructions, generic models that approximate species means, hypothetical morphologies and evolutionary intermediaries.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: In humans orbital volume increases linearly with absolute latitude. Scaling across mammals between visual system components suggests that these larger orbits should translate into larger eyes and visual cortices in high latitude humans. Larger eyes at high latitudes may be required to maintain adequate visual acuity and enhance visual sensitivity under lower light levels. Aim: To test the assumption that orbital volume can accurately index eyeball and visual cortex volumes specifically in humans. Subjects and methods: Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques are employed to measure eye and orbit ( n = 88) and brain and visual cortex ( n = 99) volumes in living humans. Facial dimensions and foramen magnum area (a proxy for body mass) were also measured. Results: A significant positive linear relationship was found between (i) orbital and eyeball volumes, (ii) eyeball and visual cortex grey matter volumes and (iii) different visual cortical areas, independently of overall brain volume. Conclusion: In humans the components of the visual system scale from orbit to eye to visual cortex volume independently of overall brain size. These findings indicate that orbit volume can index eye and visual cortex volume in humans, suggesting that larger high latitude orbits do translate into larger visual cortices.

  Abstract                 = {Facial symmetry has been proposed as a marker of developmental stability that may be important in human mate choice. Several studies have demonstrated positive relationships between facial symmetry and attractiveness. It was recently proposed that symmetry is not a primary cue to facial attractiveness, as symmetrical faces remain attractive even when presented as half faces (with no cues to symmetry). Facial sexual dimorphisms ('masculinity') have been suggested as a possible cue that may covary with symmetry in men following data on trait size/symmetry relationships in other species. Here, we use real and computer graphic male faces in order to demonstrate that (i) symmetric faces are more attractive, but not reliably more masculine than less symmetric faces and (ii) that symmetric faces possess characteristics that are attractive independent of symmetry, but that these characteristics remain at present undefined.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decade, geometric morphometric methods have been applied increasingly to the study of human form. When too few landmarks are available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points. The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not. This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy (BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained. We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement, principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small, as in the analysis of modern human populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The clinical observation has been made that the shape of the mandible changes with age in certain individuals. Because the shape and size of the mandible are so important to the human perception of youth, this observation was subjected to a pilot study. Methods: Longitudinal data available at the Bolton Brush Growth Study were evaluated. Only dentate individuals were included in the study. Serial frontal radiographs were analyzed from the same individual taken during youth and maturity for 16 individuals, eight female subjects and eight male subjects (n = 16). The mean age for youth was 16.2 years for female and male subjects. The mean age at maturity was 56.1 years for female subjects and 56.4 years for male subjects. Tracings were made of the mandibular border for each individual, at youth and at maturity. The only reliable way to analyze shape is the modern technique of geometric morphometric analysis, which was therefore used in this study. Other techniques, such as angular values and two-dimensional linear measurements, were dismissed because they have been shown to be unreliable for evaluating shape. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in shape for both male subjects and female subjects that occurred with age (p = 0.02 for female subjects and p = 0.001 for male subjects). The mandible continued to grow: the shape changed because some areas continued to grow faster than other areas. This is in accordance with the principle of differential growth of the facial skeleton. Conclusions: It is important for the cosmetic surgeon to evaluate the lower face before surgery and to understand that both bone and soft tissue can play a role in the appearance of the lower face in older individuals. A small lower face is highly attractive and conveys the impression of youth, and any soft-tissue procedure that can create the illusion of a diminutive lower face will improve the cosmetic result of the face lift procedure.},

  Abstract                 = {Variable selection has been discussed in many papers and it became an important topic in areas as chemometrics and science in general. Here a backward iterative step-by-step wrapper method is proposed using PLS. The root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) for an independent test set is used as selection criterion to quantify the gain obtained using the selected range of variables. The method has been applied to different data sets and the results obtained revealed that one can improve or at least keep constant the prediction performances of the PLS models compared to the full-spectrum models. Moreover with the advantage that the number of variables is reduced driving to an easier interpretation of the relationship between model and sample composition and/or properties. The aim is not to compare to other variable selection methods but to show that a simple one can improve or at least keep constant the prediction performances of the PLS models by using only a limited number of variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Purpose: In this retrospective study, we evaluated isolated blowout fractures of the orbital floor by region-of-interest measurements from coronal computed tomography (CT) scans and their relationship to ophthalmologic findings. Patients and Methods: Fracture area and volume of displaced tissue of blowout fractures in 38 patients were measured from coronal CT scans. Measurement was performed by identifying distances (for area calculation) of the fracture and identifying areas (for volume calculation) of the displaced tissue in each CT slice. The calculated data were then compared with the amount of enophthalmos, presence of diplopia, and limitation of ocular motility. Results: Orbital floor area (mean ± SD) was 5.72 ± 1.07 cm2; fracture area, 2.63 ± 1.20 cm2; and the volume of displaced tissue, 1.15 ± 0.91 mL. The average proportion of the fracture within the orbital floor was 45.3 ± 17.6%. Fracture area and volume of displaced tissue were significantly positively correlated with enophthalmos and diplopia and not correlated with the limitation of ocular motility. For enophthalmos of 2 mm or greater, mean fracture area (mean ± SD) was 4.08 ± 1.09 cm2 and volume of displaced tissue was 1.89 ± 1.19 mL; for less than 2-mm enophthalmos, 1.98 ± 0.83 cm2 and 0.83 ± 0.58 mL, respectively. Enophthalmos of 2 mm can be expected with 3.38 cm2 of fracture area and 1.62 mL of displaced tissue. Conclusions: Region-of-interest measurement from coronal CT scan has an application in the assessment of patients with pure blowout fractures of the orbital floor and adds useful information in posttraumatic evaluation of orbital fractures.© 2002 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 60:1267-1272, 2002},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we present a new computerized reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 Neanderthal skull and discuss its significance for Neanderthal growth and variability. Because of the precarious state of preservation of the original material, we applied entirely noninvasive methods of fossil reconstruction and morphometry, using a combination of computed tomography, computer graphics, and stereolithography.After electronic restoration, the isolated original pieces were recomposed on the computer screen using external and internal anatomical clues to position the bone fragments and mirror images to complete missing parts. The inferred effects of general compressive deformation that occurred during fossilization were corrected by virtual decompression of the skull. The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal adult state. Residual asymmetry of skeletal parts can be traced to in vivo skeletal modification: the left mandibular joint shows signs of a healed condylar fracture, and the anatomy of the occipital region suggests mild plagiocephaly.Using micro-CT analysis, the left incus could be recovered from the matrix filling of the middle ear cavity. Its morphometric dimensions are similar to those of the La Ferrassie III incus. The morphometric characteristics of the inner ear deviate substantially from the condition reported as typical for Neanderthals and fall within the range of modern human variability.

Research that has been conducted on the genetics of pigmentation has revealed polymorphisms that explain a significant proportion of the variation observed in human iris color. Here, on the basis of genetic data for the six most relevant eye color predictors, two alternative Bayesian network model variants were developed and evaluated for their accuracy in prediction of eye color. The first model assumed eye color to be categorized into blue, brown, green, and hazel, while the second variant assumed a simplified classification with two states: light and dark. It was found that particularly high accuracy was obtained for the second model, and this proved that reliable differentiation between light and dark irises is possible based on analysis of six single nucleotide polymorphisms and a Bayesian procedure of evidence interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding sexual dimorphism is very important in studies of human evolution and skeletal biology. Sexual dimorphic characteristics can be studied morphologically and metrically, although morphologic studies pose several problems such as difficulties with quantification and interobserver error. Geometric morphometrics is a relatively new method that allows better assessment of morphologic characteristics. This paper aims to investigate the usability of this method by assessing three different morphologic characteristics in a sample of South African blacks: shape of the greater sciatic notch, mandibular ramus flexure, and shape of the orbits. Relative warps, thin-plate splines, and canonical variates analysis (CVA) analyses were performed. As expected, the shape of the greater sciatic notch provided the best separation between the sexes. Surprisingly, however, the shape of the orbits performed better that ramus flexure. Several possible explanations for this result are possible, which include the possibility that orbit shape is more sexually dimorphic than previously expected, or that biological reality is not reflected by this technique. More research is, however, needed.},

These pairs of skull/ facial data have been scanned with a CT scanner, and the computed geometric three-dimensional models of both skulls and facial tissue have been built. One set of skull/facial data will be used as a reference set whereas the second set is used as ground truth for validating our method. After a semi-automatic face-skull registration, we apply an original computing global parametric transformation T that turns the reference skull into the skull to be reconstructed. This algorithm is based upon salient lines of the skull called crest lines: more precisely the crest lines of the first skull are matched to the crest lines of the second skull by an iterative closest point algorithm. Then we apply this algorithm to the reference face to obtain the "unknown" face to be reconstructed. The reliability and difficulties of this original technique are then discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In both diagnostic fields a two-stage strategy is recommended: to first use "field" methods that are quick and easy but more imprecise and then "laboratory" methods that are time consuming but more precise. In preparing skeletal work, individuality of a skeleton should be checked, traces of diseases sought and time since death assessed. For sexing non-adults, the field methods are tooth mineralisation, long bone length and a few morphological skull and pelvis characteristics, for adults it is the morphology of pelvis and skull, and for both age groups the advanced laboratory method is molecular biology. For ageing non-adults the methods are mineralisation of teeth, long bone length and epiphysis development. For ageing adults the advanced laboratory method is aspartic acid racemisation. Less accurate laboratory methods are cement ring counts and histology of bones and teeth. Quick morphological methods using the pubic symphysis and other traits in combinations follow. Finally, cranial sutures and tooth number give a quick and rough impression. For the selection of a method and the assessment of its value the stochastic error produced for the reference sample is the decisive criterion; it should also be used to assess the reliability of a single diagnosis. Prerequisites for all work with skeletons are not only a complete knowledge of the relevant biology as well as specific techniques but also initial detailed instructions and with forensic applications, personal experience.},

  Abstract                 = {Shape and size differences of the human orbital region due to sex and population affinity are crucial in physical anthropology. Especially in the context of forensics anthropometric measurements are used to find out sex and origin of the deceased. With classical anthropometric methods, though, it is not possible to distinguish between differences in size and shape. Furthermore, using the orbital index, only a minimal aspect of the shape of the orbital rim can be grasped. Hence the question remains to what extent sexual dimorphism in the orbital region is influenced by size differences between male and female individuals and how pure shape differences are expressed. The influence of population affinity on sexual dimorphism is of high interest, too. In this study, 200 surface meshes derived from CT-scans of the orbital region are analysed with the methods of Geometric Morphometrics. The data consists of evenly distributed male and female individuals of Chinese and European origin. The orbital region as a whole is analysed in contrast to a subregion representing the orbital rim. The results are compared to other studies concerning the sexual dimorphism represented in the human orbital region. It can be shown that it heavily depends on the chosen method of representing and analysing the orbital region what conclusion can be drawn.},

  Abstract                 = {The zygomatic bone is an important element of the viscerocranium. Several muscles attach here, and its shape has a marked effect on facial appearance. As a consequence, shape variation of the zygomatic bone is crucial in forensic facial reconstruction, reconstructive surgery and evolutionary studies. We analysed the shape of the zygomatic bone in 200 individuals, divided into four subgroups, representing females and males of Chinese and European origin. Our data consists of surface meshes extracted from CT-scans. First, eight manually placed landmarks provided a rough alignment of these meshes. Then, both rigid and elastic surface matching algoritms were applied, using iterative closest point matching and smoothed displacement fields. After the registration process, all vertices of the matched surfaces were corresponding throughout the sample. Based on this information, statistical shape analysis was performed, using 1000 mesh vertices. Our results show significant shape divergences related to sex and population affinity. Sex differences are hardly distinguishable with the naked eye. A comparison in terms of origin proofs the average Chinese shape to be more robust than the European. The variation depending on population affinity concentrates on the orbital border of the zygomatic bone, with less variation at the temporal border.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the 19th century, a number of collections of skeletal material, mainly skulls, from all over the world were established in Germany and elsewhere. Due to great loss in World War 2 and to relocations, the original documentation of the Alexander Ecker Collection in Freiburg is lost to a great extent. In order to be able to answer requests from indigenous groups, which will arise more often in future, it is necessary to identify the provenance of the objects held in the collection. Therefore, a project has been started to find out whether the skulls labelled as Australian aboriginals in the catalogue of the Alexander Ecker collection are in fact what they are assumed to be. In addition to a bundle of analytical methods such as DNA-analysis, craniometry and stable isotope analysis, historical information need also be considered. The poster displays how we work with UV-light to detect faded labels on the skulls which are invisible under normal daylight or electric light. We compared two lamps, a SUPERLITE 400 Economy-Set Tatortleuchte (Lumatec, Deisenhofen, Germany) and a CAMAG UV-Lampe (Camag, Berlin, Germany) and tried out different wavelengths. We found out that a small wavelength of 254 nm is best to detect the old writing. The main advantages of the method are that it is non-invasive and easy to work with for the researcher. Additionally, once a lamp is organised, the costs are very low. This method might be interesting for other collections which are not analysed so far.},

The authors sought to validate their technique and to assess the intraobserver and interobserver variability of their calculations of bony orbital volume (OV), orbital fat volume (FV), and extraocular muscle volume (MV) on CT scans of humans.methods. The authors calculated these volumes with the use of a manual segmentation technique on CT scans with commercially available software. Two observers (one of them masked) calculated the orbital soft tissue volumes in a CT scan of a phantom constructed of dry skull, butter, and chicken muscle. These calculations were compared with previously taken standard volume measurements of these materials. Repetitive calculations on one CT scan by the same observer were compared. Soft tissue volumes taken from 10 orbital CT scans were calculated by two observers and compared. From the data acquired, intraobserver and interobserver variability was calculated.results. Outcomes of these calculations using this software approximated the volumes of the phantom measured with standardized techniques. Accuracy of the phantom calculations between the two observers varied from +0.7% to ?0.7% for FV and between ?1.5% and ?2.2% for MV. Mean differences between the repeated calculations were smaller than 5%. The intraclass correlation coefficient varied from 0.961 to 0.999.conclusions. Calculating orbital soft tissue volume using a manual segmentation technique for CT scans is a reliable and accurate tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypic traits have been used for centuries for the purpose of racial classification. Developments in quantitative population genetics have allowed global comparison of patterns of phenotypic variation with patterns of variation in classical genetic markers and DNA markers. Human skin color shows a high degree of variation among geographic regions, typical of traits that show extensive natural selection. Even given this high level of geographic differentiation, skin color variation is clinal and is not well described by discrete racial categories. Craniometric traits show a level of among-region differentiation comparable to genetic markers, with high levels of variation within populations as well as a correlation between phenotypic and geographic distance. Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them are arbitrary. The race concept is at best a crude first-order approximation to the geographically structured phenotypic variation in the human species. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA have found that the amount of variation among major geographic groupings of Homo sapiens is relatively low, accounting for roughly 10% of total variation. This conclusion has had implications for the study of human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the level of among-group variation for morphological traits is much higher. This study examines the level of among-group variation based on craniometric data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics theory was used to provide an estimate of FST--a measure of among-group variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic markers. Data for 57 craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An additional set of analyses was performed using a three-region subset (Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete heritability) for the three-region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum FST for the six-region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10-0.11). The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability. Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three-region analysis and 0.144 for the six-region analysis. These results show that genetic and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively, and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major geographic regions.},

A thorough understanding of orbital anatomy is essential to fully appreciate the effects of disease on the orbit and is of paramount importance for performing safe orbital surgery.

As a consequence, all metadata required to interpret the tabular data are stored in the same file, allowing for the automated generation of publication-ready tables and graphs and the semantic searchability of data file collections. The Full-Metadata Format is introduced on the basis of three comprehensive examples. The complete format and syntax are given in the appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the relationship of skeletal facial pattern and soft-tissue nasal form. The case sample comprises 123 white female subjects, aged 11.0 to 20.6 years, with no histories of pathology, trauma, surgical intervention, or orthodontic treatment. Measurements were made from cephalometric radiographs, posteroanterior radiographs, and the physioprint photographs. Skeletal classifications were based on the relationship of the maxilla to the mandible; the three classifications were straight profile, retrusive chin profile, and prognathic profile. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to test intercorrelations of all quantitative variables (including age) with each other. Correlations were highly significant for age, the three profile measurements, and two of the frontal measurements. Hence, noses and skeletal structures showed, as expected, increases with age. Also, profile measurements were highly significantly correlated; larger noses were larger in all profile dimensions. A stepwise discriminant analysis was used to study nonquantitative categories of nasal shape (straight, convex, and concave). This analysis indicated that more than 86% of patients in the sample of 123 demonstrated a correlation of nasal shapes with specific skeletal groupings. Patients with straight profiles tended to have straight noses; convex profiles accompanied convex nasal shapes; and concave profiles were found with concave nasal shapes. The clinical significance of this research is to emphasize the importance of total facial harmony (especially nasal shape) during orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.},

Whenall eigenvectors andall harmonics are retained both approaches represent orthogonal rotations of the same points. Thus distances between pairs of shapes (and any multivariate analyses based on distances) must be the same for both analyses. When true shapes are known to be smooth, dropping higher-order Fourier harmonics results in a desirable smoothing of the digitized outline and a large reduction in computational cost.An alternative method of eigenshape analysis is presented and related to elliptical Fourier analysis and analysis of raw coordinates.},

Methods included Fourier analysis of both radii and tangent angle change functions. In addition, the relatively new method of elliptic Fourier analysis was tried. Cluster and ordination analyses based on the various sets of descriptors summarized well the pattern of similarities and differences in wing shapes, but clusters of similar wings do not agree well with traditional taxonomic groupings. The use of elliptic Fourier descriptors appears to be especially promising for future work.},

The formulas for estimating this component have been standardized for two-dimensional data but not for three-dimensional data. We suggest estimating the component by way of the complementarity between the uniform component and the space of partial warps. The component can be estimated by regression in either one space or the other: regression on the partial warps, followed by their removal, or regression on a basis for the uniform component itself. Either of the new methods can be used for both two- and three-dimensional landmark data and thus generalize Bookstein's (1996, pages 153-168 in Advances in morphometrics [L. F. Marcus et al., eds.], Plenum, New York) linearized Procrustes formula for estimating the uniform component in two dimensions.},

The results of various multivariate analyses can then be visualized by reconstruction of images as weighted linear combinations of thin-plate splines. The method was applied to data on seven species of Old World moles of the family Talpidae. There was no evidence for sexual dimorphism or any interaction between sex differences and species differences. There were large statistically significant differences among species with respect to nonaffine shape differences (local deformations). Small but statistically significant differences were found among species with respect to the uniform component of shape variation.},

Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes. Graphical techniques are also presented to help summarize the patterns of differences in shape among the objects being compared.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between allometry and sexual dimorphism in the human craniofacial complex was analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. Thin-plate splines (TPS) analysis has been applied to investigate the lateral profile of complete adult skulls of known sex. Twenty-nine three-dimensional (3D) craniofacial and mandibular landmark coordinates were recorded from a sample of 52 adult females and 52 adult males of known age and sex. No difference in the influence of size on shape was detected between sexes. Both size and sex had significant influences on shape. As expected, the influence of centroid size on shape (allometry) revealed a shift in the proportions of the neurocranium and the viscerocranium, with a marked allometric variation of the lower face. Adjusted for centroid size, males presented a relatively larger size of the nasopharyngeal space than females. A mean-male TPS transformation revealed a larger piriform aperture, achieved by an increase of the angulation of the nasal bones and a downward rotation of the anterior nasal floor. Male pharynx expansion was also reflected by larger choanae and a more posteriorly inclined basilar part of the occipital clivus. Male muscle attachment sites appeared more pronounced. In contrast, the mean-female TPS transformation was characterized by a relatively small nasal aperture. The occipital clivus inclined anteriorly, and muscle insertion areas became smoothed. Besides these variations, both maxillary and mandibular alveolar regions became prognathic. The sex-specific TPS deformation patterns are hypothesized to be associated with sexual differences in body composition and energetic requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {By providing two examples, the option for embedding 3D models in electronic versions of life science publications is presented. These examples, presumably representing the first such models published, are developmental stages of an evertebrate (Patella caerulea, Mollusca) and a vertebrate species (Psetta maxima, Teleostei) obtained from histological section series reconstruction processed with the software package Amira. These surface rendering models are particularly suitable for a PDF file because they can easily be transformed to a file format required and components may be conveniently combined and hierarchically arranged. All methodological steps starting from specimen preparation until embedding of resulting models in PDF files with emphasis on conversion of Amira data to the appropriate 3D file format are explained. Usability of 3D models in PDF documents is exemplified and advantages over 2D illustrations are discussed, including better explanation capabilities for spatial arrangements, higher information contents, and limiting options for disguising results by authors. Possibilities for additional applications reaching far beyond the examples presented are suggested. Problems such as long-term compatibility of file format and hardware plus software, editing and embedding of files, file size and differences in information contents between printed and electronic version will likely be overcome by technical development and increasing tendency toward electronic at the cost of printed publications. Since 3D visualization plays an increasing role in manifold disciplines of science and appropriate tools for the popular PDF format are readily available, we propose routine application of this way of illustration in electronic life science papers.

The analysis system is constructed from four stages; a feature based detection of fly wing structure, correspondence matching based upon the pairwise geometric histogram (PGH) representation, global location of the wing using a Probabilistic Hough Transform (PHT), and finally local correlation based refinement of individual features. We evaluate this system and compare quantitative results to manually digitized data. 1},

  Abstract                 = {The study of human craniofacial variation exemplifies general problems associated with the analysis of morphological plasticity that owe to the dependence of results on the methods by which phenotypic variation is quantified. We suggest a definition of plasticity that does not subordinate the developmental to the evolutionary: A process model in which changes are not a function of any mean or average, but only of the current state. Geometric morphometrics, a toolkit for assessing and visualizing biological form and its covariates, avoids some of the traditional pitfalls by focusing directly on the analysis of the two- and three-dimensional coordinates of anatomical landmarks. We discuss its potential relevance to phenotypic and developmental plasticity research, as well as some of its limitations, and demonstrate two useful analyses: assessment of asymmetry, and appraisal of integration. We itemize some of our previous studies on causes (inbreeding, environmental circumstances, etc.) and consequences (attractiveness perception) of asymmetry in humans, present some findings relating to the impact of sex on shape, and speculate about the adaptive relevance of one of these processes in particular. A closing argument points out that such considerations are possible only because of the careful separation of assumptions from empirical evidence entailed in the course of this type of data analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to develop in the same way under varying environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability, arising from disruptive effects of environmental and genetic stresses, can be measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry, a particularly sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with these stresses during ontogeny. In an inbred Adriatic island population, we expected dental arch fluctuating asymmetry 1) to be higher than in an outbred sample from the same island, and 2) within this population, to increase with the level of inbreeding. Due to environmental stress, we also expected to find higher fluctuating asymmetry in the outbred island population than in an urban reference group from the same country. The material consisted of 506 dental casts of 253 children from 1) the island of Hvar, and 2) Zagreb, Croatia. Three-dimensional coordinates of 26 landmarks spanning the arches were digitized. The analysis partitioned the asymmetry of arch forms into components for directional and fluctuating bilateral asymmetry, using the appropriate Procrustes method (geometric morphometrics). The results corroborated the hypotheses. Fluctuating asymmetry was found to be higher on the island than in Zagreb in all groups and in both jaws, and increased significantly with endogamy level in the lower jaw. There was no significant directional asymmetry in the Zagreb sample and likewise none in the upper jaws of the outbred island group, but significant directional asymmetry in both jaws of the inbred population and also in the lower jaws of the outbred island group. These results suggest an environmental as well as a genetic influence on dental arch asymmetry. Although the lower jaws expressed these two stresses almost additively, the upper jaws appeared to be better buffered. The role of directional asymmetry as a potential indicator of craniofacial developmental instability clearly merits further attention},

  Abstract                 = {Cues of phenotypic condition should be among those used by women in their choice of mates. One marker of better phenotypic condition is thought to be symmetrical bilateral body and facial features. However, it is not clear whether women use symmetry as the primary cue in assessing the phenotypic quality of potential mates or whether symmetry is correlated with other facial markers affecting physical attractiveness. Using photographs of men's faces, for which facial symmetry had been measured, we found a relationship between women's attractiveness ratings of these faces and symmetry, but the subjects could not rate facial symmetry accurately. Moreover, the relationship between facial attractiveness and symmetry was still observed, even when symmetry cues were removed by presenting only the left or right half of faces. These results suggest that attractive features other than symmetry can be used to assess phenotypic condition. We identified one such cue, facial masculinity (cheek-bone prominence and a relatively longer lower face), which was related to both symmetry and full- and half-face attractiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {For identifying shape changes in the human mandible associated with age, two factors were considered: shape changes associated with tooth-loss and general aging. Using CT-scans, automated landmark and surface mesh extraction of the mandible was performed on 115 individuals from Germany and China. As the Chinese individuals were only little affected by tooth-loss, even at very old age, they were used as control set for age-related changes not attributed to tooth-loss. The German sample, however, showed severe tooth-loss for older individuals.
The landmarks were used to establish an initial spatial orientation within the sample. Based on this information surface registration was performed by applying an elastic ICP-Algorithm consisting of two parts: An iterative Gaussian smoothed deformation is performed with the resulting deformation being additionally regularized by minimizing deformation energy. Due to ambivalent quality of the CT-data in the condylar region and the coronoid processes, as well as the inconsistent presence/absence of teeth, these areas were excluded from further statistical analyses. The resulting set of registered coordinates was statistically evaluated for effects of aging. The predictor age provided a high explanatory value within the German sub-sample and a low one in the Chinese data. Visualizations show a similar pattern in both populations in the gonial region. But, while these are the only shape differences among Chinese (not affected by tooth-loss), Germans exhibit significant "shrinkage" of the corpus mandibulae, when compared to the rami, owed to atrophication caused by tooth-loss.},

  Abstract                 = {In Geometric Morphometrics, most methods are applied on sparse sets of homologous landmarks, manually placed on the structures to be analysed. The drawbacks of manual landmark placement are evident: though modern digital imaging provides very accurate surface representations of biological structures, there are few landmarks that are well-defined and reliable in terms of homology and observer error. As a consequence, the rich information contained in the digital informations is poorly exploited. Many approaches to overcome these shortcomings (e.g. sliding semi-landmarks), still rely more or less on manually placed landmarks, thus being subject to observer error. We are presenting a method using smoothed displacement fields to register an atlas surface onto all other surfaces in our sample. Hereby, manual interaction is only required to place reference points establishing an initial, coarse spatial correspondence. To test the performance of our proposed method, we choose a rather complex geometric structure: the human zygomatic bone. In our study, we apply our registration method to 200 surface meshes extracted from CT-scans in order to evaluate population- and gender-specific surface shapes. 8 landmarks provide information for the surface meshes to be coarsely aligned, followed by an enhanced iterative closest point rigid body registration. The aligned surfaces now are iteratively matched onto each other using a locally smoothed displacement vector field. Finally, all surfaces are represented by meshes, consisting of corresponding vertices. Vertices within the region of interest can be processed, using the well established methods of Geometric Morphometrics.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract I n t r o d u c t i o n : The determination of age at death, stature, sex and population affinity are main tasks of forensic anthropology. As metric analyses and studies with geometric morphometrics have shown, the shape of the human skull and face is highly correlated with the geographical variation of populations. Recent approaches have shown that it is possible to determine sex and population affinity of human mandibles using geometric morphometric methods. We aimed to test with a large sample whether it is possible to determine sex and population affinity with Chinese and Caucasian data to show the capacity of these methods. M e t h o d s : We used CT-Scans of 925 Caucasian individuals (male: n = 463, female: n = 462) from the Departement of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg and 960 Chinese individuals (male: n = 469, female: n = 491) from the Department of Radiology, Shanghai, China. Only unaffected mandibles were included. The data consist of 18 bilateral anatomical landmarks which were recorded using the 3D modeling software Voxim (IVS-Solutions, Chemnitz, Germany). We used modern geometric morphometrics to extract shape data and remove information about orientation, location and size. The resulting shape data was analyzed using several multivariate statistical methods. To measure size effects, Centroid Size and log transformed Centroid Size were taken into account. R e s u l t s : Sexual dimorphism in shape as well as in size was significant within both populations. Discriminant analysis on Shape data shows a distinct sexual dimorphism and classification results could be improved, adding log transformed Centroid Size as a variable. Further analysis of the pooled data implicates that there is no common shape trajectory dividing males from females within both populations. Discrimination analysis performed on pooled data also shows a clear separation between populations and results in high classification accuracy: Of 1885 individuals, only 13 were misclassified. C o n c l u s i o n : Compared to population differences, shape difference between sexes appear to be rather small, as discrimination functions yield far better results between populations than between sexes.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The description of the human orbital shape is principally qualitative in the classical literature, and characterised by adjectives such as circular, rectangular or quadrangular. In order to provide a precise quantification and interpretation of this shape, a study based on automatic image analysis and Fourier analysis was carried out on 45 human skulls (30 males, 15 females), and for comparison on 61 skulls of Gorilla gorilla (40 males, 21 females), and 34 skulls of Pan troglodytes (20 males, 14 females). Sexual dimorphism in the shape of the orbital opening was not demonstrated. Its dominant morphological features could be characterized by Fourier analysis; elliptical elongation and quadrangularity were dominant morphological features of the shape of the orbital opening in the three species. Elliptical elongation was more marked in humans and Pan, whereas quadrangularity was particularly emphasized in Gorilla. An intraspecific variability of the shape of the orbital opening existed in humans, Gorilla and Pan, and seemed close in the three species. Interspecific partition between humans, Gorilla and Pan was demonstrated despite the variability observed in the three species studied. Interspecific differences between Gorilla and the Pan-humans group were principally explained by the differences in quadrangularity, and by differences in orientation of triangularity and pentagonality. Differences in the shape of the orbital opening between humans and Pan were principally explained by differences in hexagonality, and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity. A closeness of shape between some humans and some individuals in Pan and, to a lesser degree, with some individuals in Gorilla was observed, demonstrating the existence of a morphological continuum of the shape of the orbital opening in hominoids.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary An original procedure based on new developments in elliptical Fourier methods associated with image analysis technics was applied to 117 human mandibles in lateral view (69 males, 48 females) in order to analyze interindividual variability and sexual dimorphism. Original parameters, called elliptical Fourier descriptors, allowed for the quantification of the shape of an outline irrespective of its morphological complexity, and provided a precise individual characterization. The use of step by step reconstructions with an increasing number of harmonics allowed for demonstration of the morphological contributions of the elliptical Fourier descriptors, and relationships to precise anatomical features were established. The first harmonics (1st to 8th) described the general mandibular shape, and the later harmonics (8th to 14th) characterized accessory and finer morphological features. The proportion of individuals presenting significant sexual dimorphism was 97.1% in males and 91.7% in females, and after size normalization 84.1% in males and 81.2% in females. Even after removal of the size component, these results in regard to mandibular dimorphism remained better than those found by classical approaches; this could be due to the use of elliptical Fourier analysis which takes into account all the information of the mandibular outline. Compared to the size component, the shape component seemed to be more important in the sexual dimorphism of the human mandible than previously recognized. The present approach opens interesting anthropological and clinical perspectives for the characterization of mandibular morphology.},

Materials and Methods Patients who presented with unilateral orbital fractures to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital from March 2011 to March 2012 were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The primary predictor variable was the imaging technique (MRI vs CT). The outcome measurements were orbital volume (primary outcome) and geometric intraorbital surface deviations (secondary outcome) between the MRI- and CT-based 3D models. Results Eleven subjects (9 male) were enrolled. The patients' mean age was 30 years. On average, the MRI models underestimated the orbital volume of the CT models by 0.50 ± 0.19 cm3. The average intraorbital surface deviation between the MRI and CT models was 0.34 ± 0.32 mm, with 78 ± 2.7% of the surface within a tolerance of ±0.5 mm. Conclusions The volumetric differences of the MRI models are comparable to reported results from CT models. The intraorbital MRI surface deviations are smaller than the accepted tolerance for orbital surgical reconstructions. Therefore, the authors believe that MRI is an accurate radiation-free alternative to CT for the primary imaging and 3D reconstruction of the bony orbit.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose an algorithm for non-rigidly registering a 3D template mesh with a dense point cloud, using a morphable shape model to control the deformation of the template mesh. A cost function involving nonrigid shape as well as rigid pose is proposed. Registration is performed by minimizing a first-order approximation of the cost function in the Iterative Closest Points framework. We show how a complex shape model, consisting of multiple PCA models for individual regions of the template, can be seamlessly integrated in the parameter estimation scheme. An appropriate Tikhonov regularization is introduced to guarantee the smoothness of the full mesh despite the splitting into local models. The proposed algorithm is compared to a recent generic nonrigid registration scheme. We show that the data-driven approach is faster, as the linear systems to be solved in the iterations are significantly smaller when a model is available. Also, we show that simultaneous optimization of pose and shape yields better registration results than shape alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Two methods for registering laser-scans of human heads and transforming them to a new semantically consistent topology defined by a user-provided template mesh are described. Both algorithms are stated within the Iterative Closest Point framework. The first method is based on finding landmark correspondences by iteratively registering the vicinity of a landmark with a re-weighted error function. Thin-plate spline interpolation is then used to deform the template mesh and finally the scan is resampled in the topology of the deformed template. The second algorithm employs a morphable shape model, which can be computed from a database of laser-scans using the first algorithm. It directly optimizes pose and shape of the morphable model. The use of the algorithm with PCA mixture models, where the shape is split up into regions each described by an individual subspace, is addressed. Mixture models require either blending or regularization strategies, both of which are described in detail. For both algorithms, strategies for filling in missing geometry for incomplete laser-scans are described. While an interpolation-based approach can be used to fill in small or smooth regions, the modeldriven algorithm is capable of fitting a plausible complete head mesh to arbitrarily small geometry, which is known as "shape completion". The importance of regularization in the case of extreme shape completion is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {The facial morphology is the result of mazy interactions between environmental and epigenetic factors that lead to the composition of multiple subunits integrated to function as a whole. In this study, we combine modularity concepts from evolutionary developmental biology with unsupervised machine learning tools to provide a descriptive framework of the facial configuration of landmarks on a modular and thus local basis. We apply normalized spectral clustering to a database of 592 3D faces - represented with spatially dense meshes of 7,150 quasi-landmarks -,grouping vertices that are strongly correlated and connected to form compact modules. Given an average mesh configuration of the whole dataset, we first build the affinity matrix that encodes the similarity of each pair of landmarks. The affinity matrix assigns a high weight to strongly correlated landmark pairs while penalizing their inter-landmark geodesic distance measured on the average mesh configuration. The normalized Laplacian of the similarity matrix is then computed and its top-k eigenvectors (corresponding to the k smallest eigenvalues) are retained. The clustering is performed through the traditional k-means algorithm on the first eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, initializing the centers with a weighted probability distribution in order to account for variability due to seed selection. Since the strength of co-variation between the obtained modules is the criterion for evaluating integration and modularity in the input data, we recall the Escoufier coefficient from morphometric studies on biological shapes as a scalar measure of the co-variation between sets of landmarks. The statistical significance of the Escoufier coefficients among multiple sets of landmarks is established by means of a permutation test. The spectral clustering described in this work resultsin finding the correct patterns in a more robust and accurate way compared to other unsupervised clustering techniques such as k-means or k-means++, and the association values found on the first clusters show a good statistical significance.},

  Abstract                 = {The orbital region plays a predominant role in the evaluation of the craniofacial complex. No current normative data exist for Northern Sudanese subjects. In the current study information about normal sex- and age-related dimensions of the orbital region was provided. The three-dimensional coordinates of ten landmarks on the orbital soft tissues were obtained using a hand-held laser scanner in 654 healthy Northern Sudanese subjects aged 4-30 years. From the landmarks, biocular and intercanthal widths, paired height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal (head in natural head position) and Frankfurt plane, length and inclination of the eye fissure, the relevant ratios, were calculated, and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. All analysed linear soft-tissue orbital dimensions, except intercanthal width and left orbital height, were significantly larger in men than in women (p < 0.01). A significant sexual dimorphism was found also for the height-to-width ratios (larger in women in most age groups), the orbital inclinations vs. the true horizontal and Frankfurt plane (both measurements were almost always larger in men than in women), and the right side inclination of the eye fissure vs. the true horizontal (larger in women than in men), while no sex-related differences were observed for the left side inclination of the eye fissure vs. the true horizontal. All measurements but the right side inclination of the eye fissure vs. the true horizontal underwent significant modifications as a function of age, with several significant age x sex interactions. Biocular and intercanthal widths, orbital height, length of the eye fissure, all increased from childhood to young adulthood; in the second decade of life all age-related increments were larger in men than in women. Overall, when compared to literature data for African and Caucasoid subjects, several differences were found, pointing to the necessity of ethnic-specific data. Data collected in the present investigation could serve as a database for the quantitative description of human orbital morphology during normal growth and development. Forensic applications (evaluations of traumas, craniofacial alterations, teratogenic-induced conditions, facial reconstruction, ageing of living and dead people, personal identification) may also benefit from age- and sex-based data banks.},

  Abstract                 = {The microanatomy of the superior orbital fissure (SOF) was studied in 96 sides of cadaver specimens. The SOF is a narrow bony cleft that lies at the apex of the orbit between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid. Through this fissure, many important structures enter the orbit from the middle cranial fossa including the third, fourth, sixth cranial nerves, and the ophthalmic branch of the fifth nerve. In addition, the superior opthalmamic vein exits the orbit to drain into the cavernous sinus via the SOF. The fissure can be divided into three anatomical regions by the annulus of Zinn (common annular tendon): the lateral, central, and inferior regions. The lateral wall of the SOF can also be divided between the upper and lower segments, and the angle between them was measured to be 144.27 degrees +/- 20.03 degrees. Defining these regions is useful in describing the course and placement of the nerves and vasculature in the SOF. Managing lesions at the orbital apex requires an extensive knowledge of the cranial base and the intracranial and extracranial relationships of the anatomical structures coursing through the SOF. The goal of this study was to describe the microanatomy of the SOF region in detail and to provide a reference for surgical procedures involving the orbital apex.},

Many craniofacial differences used in forensic skeletal identification are difficult to quantify, although certain measurements of the midfacial skeleton have shown high predictive value for group classifications. This study presents a new method for analyzing midfacial shape variation between different geographic groups. Three-dimensional laser scan models of 90 crania from three populations were used to obtain cross-sectional midfacial contours defined by three standard craniometric landmarks. Elliptic Fourier transforms of the contours were used to extract Fourier coefficients for statistical analysis. After cross-validation, discriminant functions based on the Fourier coefficients provided an average of 86% correct classifications for crania from the three groups. The high rate of accuracy of this method indicates its usefulness for identifying group affinities among human skeletal remains and demonstrates the advantages of digital 3D model-based analysis in forensic research.},

The aim is to trigger recognition of the in vivo countenance of the individual by a friend or family member. A further use is in the field of archaeology. There are a number of different reconstruction methods that can be applied to complete the reconstruction, ranging from two dimensional drawings, three dimensional clay reconstructions and now, with the advances of three dimensional technology, three dimensional computerised reconstructions. Studies carried out to assess the accuracy of facial reconstructions have produced variable results over the years. Advances in three dimensional imaging techniques in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery, particularly cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), now provides an opportunity to utilise the data of live subjects and assess the accuracy of the three dimensional computerised facial reconstruction technique.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Forensic Craniofacial Reconstruction (CFR) is an investigative technique used to illicit recognition of a deceased person by reconstructing the most likely face starting from the skull. A key component in most CFR methods are estimates of facial soft tissue depths (TD) at particular points (landmarks) on the skull based on averages from databases of TD recordings. These databases vary in their method of extraction, number and position of landmarks (usually sparse &lt;100), condition of the body, population studied, and sub-categorization of the data. In this work a new dataset is presented in a novel manner based on 156 CT scans using a spatially-dense set ({\^a}¼7500) of TD recordings to allow for a complete understanding of TD variation interpolating between typical landmarks. Furthermore, to unravel the interplay between soft-tissue layers, skull and facial morphology, TD and Facial Form (FF) are investigated both separately and combined. Using a partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis, which allows for working with multivariate and spatially-dense data, on metadata of Sex, Age and BMI, different significant patterns on TD and FF variation were found. A similar, but with TD and FF combined, PLSR generated a model useful to report on both, in function of Sex, Age and BMI. In contrast to other datasets and due to the continuous nature of the regression there is no need for data sub-categorization. In further contrast, previous datasets have been presented in tabulated form, which is impractical for spatially-dense data. Instead an interactive tool was built to visualize the regression model in an accessible way for CFR practitioners as well as anatomists. The tool is free to the community and forms a base for data contributions to augment the model and its future use in practice.},

  Abstract                 = {The average thickness of soft tissues on parts of the face is known, but its variation has not been related to cranial morphology. To investigate this relationship, measurements of facial soft-tissue depths and craniometric dimensions were taken on adult, white Australian cadavers (17 male and 23 female). Significant correlations between many soft-tissue depths and craniometric dimensions were found, suggesting a relationship between the amount of soft tissue present on the face and the size of the underlying bony skeleton. Soft-tissue depths were highly positively correlated with each other; craniometric dimensions were correlated but to a lesser extent. Males had thicker soft tissues and larger craniometric dimensions than females; considerable overlap of ranges was also noted. Multiple regression analysis was used to produce equations predicting the soft-tissue depth at specified areas of the face from craniometric dimensions. A subsample of nine cadavers was examined for the effects of tissue embalming. Embalming caused significant initial increases in facial soft-tissue depths. Cadavers embalmed for less than 6 months had soft-tissue depths significantly greater than for fully embalmed cadavers. The evidence that facial soft-tissue thicknesses vary with craniofacial dimensions has implications for forensic identification, facial aesthetic surgery, and approximation of the facial features of extinct individuals.

  Abstract                 = {Face recognition is a natural human ability and a widely accepted identification and authentication method. In modern legal settings, a lot of credence is placed on identifications made by eyewitnesses. Consequently these are based on human perception which is often flawed and can lead to situations where identity is disputed. Therefore, there is a clear need to secure identifications in an objective way based on anthropometric measures. Anthropometry has existed for many years and has evolved with each advent of new technology and computing power. As a result of this, face recognition methodology has shifted from a purely 2D image-based approach to the use of 3D facial shape. However, one of the main challenges still remaining is the non-rigid structure of the face, which can change permanently over varying time-scales and briefly with facial expressions. The majority of face recognition methods have been developed by scientists with a very technical background such as biometry, pattern recognition and computer vision. This article strives to bridge the gap between these communities and the forensic science end-users. A concise review of face recognition using 3D shape is given. Methods using 3D shape applied to data embodying facial expressions are tabulated for reference. From this list a categorization of different strategies to deal with expressions is presented. The underlying concepts and practical issues relating to the application of each strategy are given, without going into technical details. The discussion clearly articulates the justification to establish archival, reference databases to compare and evaluate different strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new measure of morphological asymmetry that avoids most of the statistical problems inherent in character-by-character analysis of size or shape. The method is an application of Procrustes analysis, which computes best-fitting super-positions of configurations of landmarks to the left and right sides of a single specimen. The Procrustes method combines subtle deviations in all aspects of the landmark configuration into one net asymmetry score. Directional asymmetry is separated from fluctuating asymmetry in a simple partition of a net sum-of-squares, and geometrical details of either component can be inspected by traditional methods of multivariate statistical analysis of landmarks. We demonstrate this method in a comparison of wing venation asymmetry in male (haploid) and female (diploid) honey bees (Apis mellifera). In addition we investigate the effects of ploidy and inter-subspecies hybridization on asymmetry and wing venation abnormalities, using the subspecies A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica, and the hybrid strain. Results suggest that while the haploid males showed a higher frequency of wing venation abnormalities and greater total asymmetry than the diploid females, most of the asymmetry difference between males and females was in the form of directional, not fluctuating, asymmetry. Hybrid females had a higher frequency of wing venation abnormalities than females of either subspecies, but there were no significant differences in the mean level of asymmetry among females of A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica and hybrid Nigra. Hybrid males had higher absolute frequency of wing venation abnormalities and asymmetry than males of either subspecies. However the mean frequency of venation abnormalities did not differ significantly between Nigra and A. m. carnica males, and mean asymmetries were not significantly different between Nigra and A. m. mellifera males. We discuss the relationship which is assumed to exist between developmental stability and fluctuating asymmetry in light of our result.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the degree to which various subsets of morphological data reflect molecular relationships is crucial for studies attempting to estimate genetic relationships from patterns of morphological variation. This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided into anatomical regions: basicranium, tipper face, mandible, temporal bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium, temporal bone, upper race, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible, upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data.

  Abstract                 = {Midfacial reduction in primates has been explained as a byproduct of other growth patterns, especially the convergent orbits. This is at once an evolutionary and developmental explanation for relatively short snouts in most modern primates. Here, we use histological sections of perinatal nonhuman primates (tamarin, tarsier, loris) to investigate how orbital morphology emerges during ontogeny in selected primates compared to another euarchontan (Tupaia glis). We annotated serial histological sections for location of osteoclasts or osteoblasts, and used these to create three-dimensional "modeling maps" showing perinatal growth patterns of the facial skeleton. In addition, in one specimen we transferred annotations from histological sections to CT slices, to create a rotatable 3D volume that shows orbital modeling. Our findings suggest that growth in the competing orbital and neurocranial functional matrices differs among species, influencing modeling patterns. Distinctions among species are observed in the frontal bone, at a shared interface between the endocranial fossa and the orbit. The medial orbital wall is extensively resorptive in primates, whereas the medial orbit is generally depositional in Tupaia. As hypothesized, the orbital soft tissues encroach on available interorbital space. However, eye size cannot, by itself, explain the extent of reduction of the olfactory recess. In Loris, the posterior portion of medial orbit differed from the other primates. It showed evidence of outward drift where the olfactory bulb increased in cross-sectional area. We suggest the olfactory bulbs are significant to orbit position in strepsirrhines, influencing an expanded interorbital breadth at early stages of development.

However, if a decedent is decomposed or only skeletal remains are found, this critical, visibly identifying information is lost. It would be beneficial to use genetic information to reveal these visible characteristics. In this study, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located in and nearby genes known for their important role in pigmentation, were validated on 554 samples, donated from non-related individuals of various populations. Six SNPs were used in predicting the eye color of an individual, and all seven were used to describe the skin coloration. The outcome revealed that these markers can be applied to all populations with very low error rates. However, the call-rate to determine the skin coloration varied between populations, demonstrating its complexity. Overall, these results prove the importance of these seven SNPs for potential forensic tests.},

Prerequisites are limited to basic knowledge of linear algebra and statistics at the price of a somewhat less compact presentation.

Updated grand means show that the new data have negligible impact on the previously published statistics: maximum change 1.7 mm at gonion; and  mm at 93% of all landmarks measured. This confirms the utility of the 2008 T-Table as a proxy to soft tissue depth population means and, together with updated sample sizes (8851 individuals at pogonion), earmarks the 2013 T-Table as the premier mean facial soft tissue depth standard for craniofacial identification casework. The utility of the T-Table, in comparison with shorths and 75-shormaxes, is also discussed.},

Elliptical Fourier analysis is used to quantify the clavicle outline shape from skeletons and postero-anterior antemortem chest radiographs to rank individuals in terms of metric distance. Similar to leading fingerprint identification systems, shortlists of the top matching candidates are extracted for subsequent human visual assessment. Two independent tests of the computerized system using 17 field-recovered skeletons and 409 chest radiographs demonstrate that true-positive matches are captured within the top 5% of the sample 75% of the time. These results are outstanding given the eroded state of some field-recovered skeletons and the faintness of the 1950's photofluorographs. These methods enhance the capability to resolve several hundred cold cases for which little circumstantial information exists and current DNA and dental record technologies cannot be applied.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The success of facial approximation is thought to depend, at least in part, upon the "accuracy" of the constructed face. However, methods of accuracy assessment are varied and this range in methods may be responsible for the disparate results reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine if the accuracy results of one facial approximation were comparable across two different assessment methods (resemblance ratings and simultaneous face array tests using unfamiliar assessors) and if resemblance ratings co-varied with recognition responses. True-positive recognition performance from the facial approximation was poor (21%) while resemblance scores using the same facial approximation were moderately high (3 out of 5 on a five-point scale). These results are not, therefore, consistent and indicate that either different variables are being evaluated by the methods, or the same variable is being examined but with different weight/calibration. Further resemblance ratings tests of the facial approximation to three foil faces from the face array revealed that resemblance scores were similar irrespective of which face was compared, and did not closely correspond with the degree of recognition performance. This was especially the case for isolated comparisons of single faces to the facial approximation. Collectively, these results indicate that resemblance ratings are: (i) insensitive measures of a facial approximation's accuracy; and (ii) inconsistent with results of unfamiliar simultaneous face-array recognition results. These data suggest that familiar and unfamiliar recognition tests should be given increased weight in contrast to current resemblance rating tests.},

  Abstract                 = {An accurate understanding of the spatial relationships between the deep and superficial structures of the head is essential for anthropological methods concerned with the comparison of faces to skulls (superimposition) or the prediction of faces from them (facial approximation). However, differences of opinion exist concerning: (i) the position of the eyeball in planes other than the anteroposterior plane and (ii) the canthi positions relative to the bony orbital margins. This study attempts to clarify the above relationships by dissection of a small sample of adult human cadavers (N = 4, mean age = 83 years, s = 12 years). The most notable finding was that the eyeballs were not centrally positioned within the orbits as the more recent craniofacial identification literature expounds. Rather, the eyeballs were consistently positioned closer to the orbital roof and lateral orbital wall (by 1-2 mm on average); a finding consistent with the earlier anatomical literature. While these estimation errors are small ipsilaterally, several factors make them meaningful: (i) the orbital region is heavily used for facial recognition; (ii) the width error is doubled because the eyes are bilateral structures; (iii) the eyes are sometimes used to predict/assess other soft tissue facial structures; and (iv) the net error in facial approximation rapidly accumulates with the subsequent prediction of each independent facial feature. While the small sample size of this study limits conclusive generalizations, the new data presented here nonetheless have immediate application to craniofacial identification practice because the results are evidence based. In contrast, metric data have never been published to support the use of the central positioning guideline. Clearly, this study warrants further quantification of the eyeball position in larger samples and preferably of younger individuals.},

In this study, clavicle shape changes due to radiographic positioning and 3D laser scanning were examined in 20 right-side specimens, as pertinent to chest radiograph comparisons. Results indicate substantial changes in clavicle form with short source-to-image receptor distance, elevation of the element from the image receptor, and movement of the element away from the center beam (10% mean square for shape). Although quantitative shape differences were small when the clavicle was in close opposition to the image receptor (3% mean square), important qualitative differences remained with large distances from the center beam (e.g., conoid tubercle presence/absence). The significance of these results for image superimposition and computer-automated-shape-based searches of radiographic libraries to find matching candidates is discussed.},

This paper redresses these limitations using FSTDs from 10 prior studies (n=516). Measurement uncertainty was large (>20% of the FSTD), skewness existed at 11 of the 23 FSTD landmarks examined, and sex and age each explained <4% of the total FSTD variance ({\^I}·2 calculated as part of MANOVA). These results call for a new and improved conceptualization of FSTDs, which is attained by the replacement of arithmetic means with shorths and 75-shormaxes. The outcomes of this implementation are dramatic reduction in FSTD complexity; improved data accuracy; and new data-driven standards for casework application of methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Archival sources of data are critical anthropological resources that inform inferences about human biology and evolutionary history. Craniometric data are one of the most widely available sources of information on human population history because craniometrics were critical in early 20th century debates about race and biological variation. As such, extensive databases of raw craniometric data were published at the same time that the field was working to standardize measurement protocol. Hrdlicka published between 10 and 16 raw craniometric variables for over 8,000 individuals in a series of seven catalogs throughout his career. With a New World emphasis, Hrdlicka's data complement those of Howells (1973, 1989) and the two databases have been combined in the past. In this note we verify the consistency of Hrdlicka's measurement protocol throughout the Catalog series and compare these definitions to those used by Howells. We conclude that 12 measurements are comparable throughout the Catalogs, with five of these equivalent to Howells' measurements: maximum cranial breadth (XCB), basion-bregma height (BBH), maximum bizygomatic breadth (ZYB), nasal breadth (NLB), and breadth of the upper alveolar arch (MAB). Most of Hrdlicka's measurements are not strictly comparable to those of Howells, thus limiting the utility of combined datasets for multivariate analysis. Four measurements are inconsistently defined by Hrdlicka and we recommend not using these data: nasal height, orbit breadth, orbit height, and menton-nasion height. This note promotes Hrdlicka's tireless efforts at data collection and re-emphasizes observer error as a legitimate concern in craniometry as the field shifts to morphometric digital data acquisition.

  Abstract                 = {The synthesis of the visible pigment melanin by the melanocyte cell is the basis of the human pigmentary system, those genes directing the formation, transport and distribution of the specialised melanosome organelle in which melanin accumulates can legitimately be called pigmentation genes. The genes involved in this process have been identified through comparative genomic studies of mouse coat colour mutations and by the molecular characterisation of human hypopigmentary genetic diseases such as OCA1 and OCA2. The melanocyte responds to the peptide hormones [alpha]-MSH or ACTH through the MC1R G-protein coupled receptor to stimulate melanin production through induced maturation or switching of melanin type. The pheomelanosome, containing the key enzyme of the pathway tyrosinase, produces light red/yellowish melanin, whereas the eumelanosome produces darker melanins via induction of additional TYRP1, TYRP2, SILV enzymes, and the P-protein. Intramelanosomal pH governed by the P-protein may act as a critical determinant of tyrosinase enzyme activity to control the initial step in melanin synthesis or TYRP complex formation to facilitate melanogenesis and melanosomal maturation. The search for genetic variation in these candidate human pigmentation genes in various human populations has revealed high levels of polymorphism in the MC1R locus, with over 30 variant alleles so far identified. Functional correlation of MC1R alleles with skin and hair colour provides evidence that this receptor molecule is a principle component underlying normal human pigment variation.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess craniometric variation in 153 individually dated human crania from South Africa with the aim of investigating genetic continuity/discontinuity during the Holocene. Evidence from the archaeological record is used to pinpoint likely episodes of genetic discontinuity. Craniometric data are then used to assess the likelihood of genetic change having occurred. Two periods of possible genetic discontinuity are identified: i) c. 4,000 BP, when an increase in overall population size, shifts in site organization and diet, and reduced mobility, were accompanied by reductions in stature; ii) c. 2,000 BP, when the herding of domesticates and the use of pottery vessels were introduced into the region. Results indicate that there was a decrease in cranial size and concomitant size-related changes in craniofacial shape between c.4,000 BP and 3,000 BP. This was followed almost immediately by a recovery in craniofacial size and a return to pre-4,000 BP craniofacial shape at c. 3,000 BP. This recovery continued gradually, extending into the herder period without any major shifts in morphology at 2,000 BP. It is suggested that the fluctuations in craniofacial size/shape were related to changes in environmental factors. Results obtained are consistent with long term continuity in South African Later Stone Age populations during the Holocene.},

  Abstract                 = {Creating a feature-preserving average of three dimensional anatomical surfaces extracted from volume image data is a complex task. Unlike individual images, averages present right-left symmetry and smooth surfaces which give insight into typical proportions. Averaging multiple biological surface images requires careful superimposition and sampling of homologous regions. Our approach to biological surface image averaging grows out of a wireframe surface tessellation approach by Cutting et al. (1993). The surface delineating wires represent high curvature crestlines. By adding tile boundaries in flatter areas the 3D image surface is parametrized into anatomically labeled (homology mapped) grids. We extend the Cutting et al. wireframe approach by encoding the entire surface as a series of B-spline space curves. The crestline averaging algorithm developed by Cutting et al. may then be used for the entire surface. Shape preserving averaging of multiple surfaces requires careful positioning of homologous surface regions such as these B-spline space curves. We test the precision of this new procedure and its ability to appropriately position groups of surfaces in order to produce a shape-preserving average. Our result provides an average that well represents the source images and may be useful clinically as a deformable model or for animation.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent evidence suggests that certain features on the human face indicate hormonal levels during growth, and that women judge the attractiveness of potential partners based on the appearance of these features. One entrenched notion is male facial features that are affected by testosterone are used as direct cues in mate preference. Testosterone may be particularly revealing as it is purported to be an honest indicator of male fitness. Increased testosterone may impose an immunocompetence handicap on the bearer and only the best males can carry this handicap. To date, tests of this theory have been indirect, and have relied on digital manipulations that represent unrealistic continuums of masculine and feminine faces. We provide a much more direct test by manipulating digitally male faces to mimic known shape variation, caused by varying levels of testosterone through puberty. We produced a continuum of faces that ranged from low to high levels of testosterone in male faces and asked women to choose the points on the continuum that appeared most attractive and most physically dominant. Our data indicate that high testosterone faces reveal dominance. However, there is no evidence of directional selection for increased (or decreased) testosterone in terms of attractiveness to the opposite sex. We discuss the relevance and applicability of evolutionary interpretations of our data and, contrary to predictions, provide evidence of stabilizing selection acting on testosterone through mate preferences.},

The baseline for all allometric relationships is isometry (or geometric similarity), the principal that shape is invariant of size. Here, we formally test for geometric similarity in modern humans, looking at the maximum lengths of four long bones (humerus, radius, femur, and tibia). We use Jolicoeur's multivariate allometry method to examine globally distributed samples of human populations, both collectively and individually. Results indicate that humans are not geometrically similar, although morphological deviations from isometry are small.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new method for determining the minimal non-rigid deformation between two 3-D surfaces, such as those which describe anatomical structures in 3-D medical images. Although we match surfaces, we represent the deformation as a volumetric transformation. Our method performs a least squares minimization of the distance between the two surfaces of interest. To quickly and accurately compute distances between points on the two surfaces, we use a precomputed distance map represented using an octree spline whose resolution increases near the surface. To quickly and robustly compute the deformation, we use a second octree spline to model the deformation function. The coarsest level of the deformation encodes the global (e.g., affine) transformation between the two surfaces, while finer levels encode smooth local displacements which bring the two surfaces into closer registration. We present experimental results on both synthetic and real 3-D surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Diagenetic distortion can be a major obstacle to collecting quantitative shape data on paleontological specimens, especially for three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis. Here we utilize the recently -published algorithmic symmetrization method of fossil reconstruction and compare it to the more traditional reflection &amp; averaging approach. In order to have an objective test of this method, five casts of a female cranium of <italic>Papio hamadryas kindae</italic> were manually deformed while the plaster hardened. These were subsequently "retrodeformed" using both algorithmic symmetrization and reflection &amp; averaging and then compared to the original, undeformed specimen. We found that in all cases, algorithmic retrodeformation improved the shape of the deformed cranium and in four out of five cases, the algorithmically symmetrized crania were more similar in shape to the original crania than the reflected &amp; averaged reconstructions. In three out of five cases, the difference between the algorithmically symmetrized crania and the original cranium could be contained within the magnitude of variation among individuals in a single subspecies of <italic>Papio</italic>. Instances of asymmetric distortion, such as breakage on one side, or bending in the axis of symmetry, were well handled, whereas symmetrical distortion remained uncorrected. This technique was further tested on a naturally deformed and fossilized cranium of <italic>Paradolichopithecus arvernensis.</italic> Results, based on a principal components analysis and Procrustes distances, showed that the algorithmically symmetrized <italic>Paradolichopithecus</italic> cranium was more similar to other, less-deformed crania from the same species than was the original. These results illustrate the efficacy of this method of retrodeformation by algorithmic symmetrization for the correction of asymmetrical distortion in fossils. Symmetrical distortion remains a problem for all currently developed methods of retrodeformation.</p>},

An inherent problem of these approximation algorithms is that the resulting curves and surfaces appear faceted. Boundary-following and iso-surface construction algorithms are typical examples. To reduce the apparent faceting, smoothing methods are used. In this paper, we introduce a new method for smoothing piecewise linear shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. This new method is in fact a linear low-pass filter that removes high-curvature variations, and does not produce shrinkage. Its computational complexity is linear in the number of edges or faces of the shape, and the required storage is linear in the number of vertices},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The chin, or mentum osseum, is one of the most distinctive anatomical traits of modern humans. A variety of hypotheses for the adaptive value of the chin have been proposed, ranging from mechanical stress resistance to sexual selection via mate choice. While the sexual selection hypothesis predicts dimorphism in chin shape, most biomechanical hypotheses preclude it. Therefore determining the presence or absence of significant sexual dimorphism in chin shape provides a useful method for differentiating between various adaptive hypotheses; however, this has yet to be done due to a lack of quantitative data on chin shape. The goals of this study are therefore: (1) to introduce a new method for quantifying chin shape and (2) to determine the presence or absence of sexual dimorphism in chin shape in a diverse sample of modern humans. Samples were drawn from recent human skeletal collections representing nine geographic regions. Outlines of mentum osseum contours were quantified using elliptical Fourier function analysis (EFFA). Fourier coefficients were analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA). Sexual dimorphism in chin shape was assessed using PC loadings in the pooled geographic sample, and statistically significant differences were found. These findings provide the first quantitative, morphologically based evidence in support of adaptive hypotheses that predict dimorphism in chin shape, including the sexual selection hypothesis.

Since they consider the whole head as the object of interest, usual reconstruction techniques are global and involve a large number of parameters to be estimated. We present a local technique which aims at reaching a good trade-off between bias and variance following the paradigm of non-parametric statistics. The estimation is localized on patches delimited by surface geodesics between anatomical points of the skull. The technique relies on a continuous representation of the individual surfaces embedded in the vectorial space of extended normal vector fields. This allows to compute deformations and averages of surfaces. It consists in estimating the soft-tissue surface over patches. Using a homogeneous database described in [31], we obtain results on the chin and nasal regions with an average error below 1 mm, outperforming the global reconstruction techniques.},

We assume that the type and frequency of these supraorbital structures may depend on the climatic conditions in which the population lived. Populations from colder regions should have a higher frequency of foramina and populations from warmer climates should have a higher frequency of supraorbital notches than other populations. This may be a result of adaptive changes and developmental responses to ambient temperatures, for prevention of heat loss in the supraorbital neurovascular bundle passing through these supraorbital structures. Localisation of the supraorbital neurovascular bundle is higher and deeper when it passes through the foramen than in the notch.},

Not so long ago, working on the origins of modern humans was a niche cloaked in convenient obscurity. Many human paleontologists were content to largely ignore, and thus remained ignorant of, the hominid fossils of the later Pleistocene, an attitude parallel to that of Bordes regarding the Neolithic in comparison to the more glamorous Paleolithic; he referred to the former simply as, ldquoC'est de la merde!rdquo However, the Neandertais have become a topic guaranteed to attract attention, thus drawing in scholars who until recently disdained interest in such basically human fossil hominids. They are now willing to direct their students' and even their own research toward late archaic humans (such as Neandertals) and early modern humans in whatever portion of the Old World is most readily available.},

The pericranial flap was used in 1 patient with a large orbital bony defect and the galeopericranial flap was used in 3 patients with various periocular defects produced by trauma or following tumor extirpation. In the case of an orbital defect induced by chronic cocaine abuse, the pericranial flap successfully sequestered the orbit from the nasal cavity while providing support for the globe. In 3 of the 4 cases involving eyelid reconstruction, the galeopericranial flap served a dual function in providing vascular supply to the underlying free tarsal graft and to the overlying free skin graft. This tissue flap is analogous to a median forehead flap, except skin is not transposed and a second-stage inset revision is not required.},

A comprehensive Computed Tomography (CT) head-scan database is currently being collected which will enable a new approach to forensic facial reconstruction. Using this unique resource, we show how a face space can be tailored to a specific unknown, or questioned skull. A set of database derived estimates of the questioned face is constructed by first computing non-rigid transformations between the known head-scan skulls and the questioned skull followed by application of these transformations to the known head-scan faces. This effectively factors out influences due to skeletal variation. A tailored face space is formed by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to this ensemble of estimates of the questioned face. Thus, the face space is a direct approximation of correlated soft tissue variance indicative of the population. Ours is the first mathematical representation of the face continuum associated with a given skull. Embedded in this space resides the elements needed for recognition.},

Primarily, this is because of the method's underlying qualitative basis but other factors contribute including: misreports in the secondary literature of Gerasimov's method essence; a lack of published details concerning Gerasimov's modeling mastic; Gerasimov's deviation from his own published nose projection prediction guidelines; and continued refinement of the methods in the 15 years following their foremost publication. As Gerasimov cannot be consulted to resolve these issues, we provide solutions via one of his five former principal students. This includes clarification of Gerasimov's method and use of soft tissue depths; the constitution of his modeling mastic; methods used for nose projection prediction; and refinements made to his methods following their primary publication.},

  Abstract                 = {The shape of the orbital rim is one of the essential craniofacial features that play a crucial role in face perception, recognition, or personal identification. As a consequence, it continues to attract a large variety of researchers, e.g., skeletal or forensic anthropologists, anatomists, physicians, psychologists etc. Despite being a focus since the rise of traditional anthropometrics, the 3-D nature of the orbital rim has not been satisfactorily quantified. This paper presents an approach to numerically describe the within- and among-population shape variation of the orbital rim, its curviness and spatial orientation using elliptic Fourier analysis. The sample consisted of 336 crania from present-day skeletal collections (Czech Republic, Portugal). For each specimen, a pair of orbital outlines was recorded using the MicroScribe G2X, a portable digitizer. Regardless of the body side, the trace line started and ended at dacryon located on the inner margin of the orbital rim. Cartesian coordinates of three fixed points defining a 3-D Frankfurt Horizontal plane were also acquired. In order to align for spatial orientation of the orbits, each pair was rotated to the Frankfurt Horizontal. The outlines were divided into 150 evenly distributed points and subsequently processed using elliptic Fourier analysis with 20 harmonics. The results showed that the specimen's population affinity, sex, age and body size are factors responsible for the shape of the orbital rim. In contrast to the generally assumed pattern of sex differences, the shape of frontally-viewed orbits failed to act as a good sex predictor. Sex-related differences, as described by 3-D shape analysis, were linked mostly to a specific "curviness" and to spatial arrangement of orbits within the craniofacial skeleton. Whereas the male orbital outline is characteristically curved and placed in the frontal plane, the female outline is flat and diverged. The results demonstrate that elliptic Fourier analysis is a powerful methodological tool that can provide new insights into the structural relationships within biological objects.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates intra- and interobserver measurement error in craniometry. Data consists of 72 craniometric measurements taken on a series of 28 Sadlermuit Eskimo crania. Utermohle measured the series twice; Zegura measured it once. Statistical procedures used to demonstrate measurement imprecision include the mean difference, the method error statistic, two-way anova without replication, the t-test for paired comparisons, Fisher's distribution-free sign test, and the t-test for independent samples. The results indicate less intraobserver repeatability than expected as well as an alarming lack of interobserver reproducibility for many of these craniometric measurements. We hope these results will serve as a caution against the widespread belief that craniometric measurements are always produced with a high degree of precision by experienced craniometrists. In addition, these results suggest that investigators employing craniometric measurements to study population affinities, functional morphology, forensics, fossil primates, and human microevolution might profit from conducting a measurement error analysis as an important baseline for the interpretation of the biological significance of their results.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Facial reconstruction is used in forensic anthropology to recreate the face from unknown human skeletal remains, and to elucidate the antemortem facial appearance. This requires accurate assessment of the skull (age, sex, ancestry, etc.) and thickness data. However, additional information is required to reconstruct the face as the information obtained from the skull is limited. Here, we aimed to examine the information from the skull that is required for accurate facial reconstruction. The human facial profile is classified into 3 shapes: straight, convex, and concave. These facial profiles facilitate recognition of individuals. The skeletal classes used in orthodontics are classified according to these 3 facial types. We have previously reported the differences between Japanese females. In the present study, we applied this classification for facial tissue measurement, compared the differences in tissue depth of each skeletal class for both sexes in the Japanese population, and elucidated the differences between the skeletal classes.},

  Abstract                 = {Developmental instability (DI) reflects the inability of a developing organism to buffer its development against random perturbations, due either to frequent, large perturbations or to a poor buffering system. The primary measure used to assess DI experienced by an individual organism is fluctuating asymmetry (FA), asymmetry of bilateral features that are, on average in a population, symmetrical. A large literature on FA in humans in relation to measures of health and quality (close to 100 studies and nearly 300 individual effect size estimates) has accumulated. This paper presents the first quantitative meta-analysis of this literature. The mean effect size (scaled as Pearson r) was about 0.2. Effect sizes covaried negatively with sample size, consistent with effects of publication bias, the tendency for significant effects to be published. Conservative correction for this bias reduced the mean effect to about 0.1. Associations with FA underestimate effects of underlying DI due to imprecise measurement of the latter. A model-based best estimate of the mean effect of DI on outcomes is about 0.3, a theoretically meaningful, relatively large effect, albeit of moderate absolute size. The data are consistent, however, with a range of true effect sizes between 0.08 and 0.67, partly due to large study effects. Study-specific effect sizes in DI ranged between {\^a}0.2 and 1.0. A humbling and perhaps sobering conclusion is that, in spite of a large body of literature involving nearly 50{\^A} 000 participants, we can only confidently state that there is on average a robust positive average effect size. An accurate estimate of that effect size was not possible, and between-study variation remained largely unexplained. We detected no robust variation across six broad categories of outcomes (health and disease, fetal outcomes, psychological maladaptation, reproduction, attractiveness and hormonal effects), though examination of narrower domains reveal some corrected effects close to 0.2 and others near zero. The meta-analysis suggests fruitful directions for future research and theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Facial reconstruction has until now been carried out by the sculpting technique. This method involves building a face with clay or other suitable material on to a skull or its cast, taking into account appropriate facial thickness measurements together with information provided by anthropologists such as approximate age, sex, race and other individual indiosyncrasies. A method for facial reconstruction is presented using 3-D computer graphics and is compared with the manual technique. The computer method involves initially digitising a skull using a laser scanner and video camera interfaced to a computer. A face, from a data bank which has previously digitised facial surfaces, is then placed over the skull in the form of a mask and the skin thickness is altered to conform with the underlying skull. The advantage of the computer method is its speed and flexibility. We have shown that the computer method for reconstructing a face is feasible and furthermore has the advantage over the manual technique of speed and flexibility. Nevertheless, the technique is far from perfect. Further facial thickness data needs collecting and the method requires evaluation using both known control skulls and later unknown remains.},

Skull and facial data from living subjects is acquired using an optical laser scanning system. For the production of the reconstructed image, we employ facial reconstruction software which is constructed using the TCL/Tk scripting language, the latter making use of the C3D system. The computer image may then be exported to enable the production of a solid model, employing, for example, stereolithography. The image can also be modified within an identikit system which allows the addition of facial features as appropriate.},

Analyses of surviving archaic lineages suggests that there were fitness costs to hybridization, admixture occurred both before and subsequent to divergence of non-African modern humans, and Neandertals were a source of adaptive variation for loci involved in skin phenotypes. Our results provide a new avenue for paleogenomics studies, allowing substantial amounts of population-level DNA sequence information to be obtained from extinct groups even in the absence of fossilized remains.},

Weltkrieg, Weimarer Republik, Note: 5,5 (CH) = 1,5 (D), Universit{\"a}t Bern (Historisches Institut), Sprache: Deutsch, Anmerkungen: Dass Wissenschaftler der deutschen Anthropologie/V{\"o}lkerkunde in NS-Verbrechen verstrickt waren ist wenig {\"u}berraschend, hantierten sie doch mit Rassentheorien aller Art. Unklar war aber, inwieweit sie schon vor 1933 f{\"u}r die NS-Ideologie empf{\"a}nglich waren. Diese Arbeit untersucht daher die f{\"u}hrenden Wissenschaftler der Weimarer Zeit, die an deutschen Unis lehrten. Das Ergebnis ist ersch{\"u}tternd: Bei den meisten paarten sich primitivste Rassenvorurteile mit pseudowissenschaftlichen Verlautbarungen., Abstract: Noch heute herrscht in der Wissenschaftsgeschichte zuweilen die Tendenz, Rassenideologien und Rassentheorien auf am Rande stehende politische Extremisten und Pseudo-Wissenschaftler zur{\"u}ckzuf hren. Dies betrifft unter anderem auch die Frage, welchen theoretischen Beitrag die Wissenschaft - und in diesem Kontext insbesondere die Lehre vom Menschen, also die Anthropologie oder Humanbiologie - f{\"u}r die Rassenlehren im Nationalsozialismus geleistet hat und inwieweit sie eine geistige Mitt{\"a}terschaft an den Massenmorden tr{\"a}gt. Bis vor einigen Jahren war die Ansicht verbreitet, dass die unpolitische und passive Wissenschaftsgilde unter dem Druck des totalit{\"a}ren Systems gestanden habe und machtlos h{\"a}tte zusehen m{\"u}ssen, wie Politiker und Ideologen die Anthropologie f{\"u}r ihre rassenpolitischen Zwecke missbrauchten. Die neuesten wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse deuten dagegen auf eine weit {\"u}ber die nationalsozialistische Epoche hinaus f{\"u}hrende Kontinuit{\"a}t rassistischer Denkmuster in der deutschen Anthropologie hin. Diese Arbeit m{\"o}chte mit einer historischen Analyse der deutschen Anthropologie einen Beitrag an die gerade erst einsetzende Aufarbeitung der Geschichte des Fachs leisten. K{\"u}rzlich sind zwar ergiebige Biografien einiger f{\"u}hrender Anthropologen und Rassentheoretiker entstanden.},

  Abstract                 = {New properties of latent root regression are shown aiding insight into the determination of a prediction model. Moreover, a procedure for the determination of a prediction model is discussed. It has similarities to partial least squares and differ from the latter method only in the way components used as predictors are formed. This procedure is extended to the case where the problem at hand concerns the prediction of more than one variable. The method is illustrated using real data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a technique for smoothing polygonal surface meshes that avoids the well-known problem of deformation and shrinkage caused by many smoothing methods, like e.g. the Laplacian algorithm. The basic idea is to push the vertices of the smoothed mesh back towards their previous locations. This technique can be also used in order to smooth unstructured point sets, by reconstructing a surface mesh to which the smoothing technique is applied. The key observation is that a surface mesh which is not necessarily topologically correct, but which can efficiently be reconstructed, is sufficient for that purpose.},

Previous studies have measured the subtalar joint axis against the axis of the whole foot, the talocrural joint axis and, recently, the principal axes of the talus. The present study introduces a new method for estimating average joint axes from 3D reconstructions of bones and applies the method to the talus to calculate the subtalar and talocrural joint axes. The study also assesses the validity of the principal axes as a reference coordinate system against which to measure the subtalar joint axis. In order to define the angle of the subtalar joint axis relative to that of another axis in the talus, we suggest measuring the subtalar joint axis against the talocrural joint axis. We present corresponding 3D vector angles calculated from a modern human skeletal sample. This method is applicable to virtual 3D models acquired through surface-scanning of disarticulated osteological samples, as well as to 3D models created from CT or MRI scans.},

  Abstract                 = {The IrisPlex system consists of a highly sensitive multiplex genotyping assay together with a statistical prediction model, providing users with the ability to predict blue and brown human eye colour from DNA samples with over 90% precision. This [`]DNA intelligence' system is expected to aid police investigations by providing phenotypic information on unknown individuals when conventional DNA profiling is not informative. Falling within the new area of forensic DNA phenotyping, this paper describes the developmental validation of the IrisPlex assay following the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) guidelines for the application of DNA-based eye colour prediction to forensic casework. The IrisPlex assay produces complete SNP genotypes with only 31pg of DNA, approximately six human diploid cell equivalents, and is therefore more sensitive than commercial STR kits currently used in forensics. Species testing revealed human and primate specificity for a complete SNP profile. The assay is capable of producing accurate results from simulated casework samples such as blood, semen, saliva, hair, and trace DNA samples, including extremely low quantity samples. Due to its design, it can also produce full profiles with highly degraded samples often found in forensic casework. Concordance testing between three independent laboratories displayed reproducible results of consistent levels on varying types of simulated casework samples. With such high levels of sensitivity, specificity, consistency and reliability, this genotyping assay, as a core part of the IrisPlex system, operates in accordance with SWGDAM guidelines. Furthermore, as we demonstrated previously, the IrisPlex eye colour prediction system provides reliable results without the need for knowledge on the bio-geographic ancestry of the sample donor. Hence, the IrisPlex system, with its model-based prediction probability estimation of blue and brown human eye colour, represents a useful tool for immediate application in accredited forensic laboratories, to be used for forensic intelligence in tracing unknown individuals from crime scene samples.},

  Abstract                 = {A new era of [`]DNA intelligence' is arriving in forensic biology, due to the impending ability to predict externally visible characteristics (EVCs) from biological material such as those found at crime scenes. EVC prediction from forensic samples, or from body parts, is expected to help concentrate police investigations towards finding unknown individuals, at times when conventional DNA profiling fails to provide informative leads. Here we present a robust and sensitive tool, termed IrisPlex, for the accurate prediction of blue and brown eye colour from DNA in future forensic applications. We used the six currently most eye colour-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that previously revealed prevalence-adjusted prediction accuracies of over 90% for blue and brown eye colour in 6168 Dutch Europeans. The single multiplex assay, based on SNaPshot chemistry and capillary electrophoresis, both widely used in forensic laboratories, displays high levels of genotyping sensitivity with complete profiles generated from as little as 31pg of DNA, approximately six human diploid cell equivalents. We also present a prediction model to correctly classify an individual's eye colour, via probability estimation solely based on DNA data, and illustrate the accuracy of the developed prediction test on 40 individuals from various geographic origins. Moreover, we obtained insights into the worldwide allele distribution of these six SNPs using the HGDP-CEPH samples of 51 populations. Eye colour prediction analyses from HGDP-CEPH samples provide evidence that the test and model presented here perform reliably without prior ancestry information, although future worldwide genotype and phenotype data shall confirm this notion. As our IrisPlex eye colour prediction test is capable of immediate implementation in forensic casework, it represents one of the first steps forward in the creation of a fully individualised EVC prediction system for future use in forensic DNA intelligence.},

  Abstract                 = {In adult human subjects, the correlations were determined between the cross-sectional areas of the jaw muscles (measured in CT scans) and a number of facial angles and dimensions (measured from lateral radiographs). Multivariate statistical analysis of the skeletal variables in a group of 50 subjects led to the recognition of six independent factors determining facial shape, i.e, 1) cranial base length, 2) lower facial height, 3) cranial base flexure and prognathism, 4) facial width, 5) mandibular length, and 6) upper facial height. In 29 of these subjects, the cross-sectional areas of the jaw muscles were determined, and correlations between these areas and the scores on the above-mentioned factors were calculated. It appeared that the cross-sectional areas of temporalis and masseter muscles correlated positively with facial width, whereas the areas of masseter and both pterygoid muscles did so with mandibular length. It has been shown experimentally that a decrease in jaw muscle size in various animals likewise has an effect on facial width and mandibular length. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that in man too the jaw muscles affect facial growth and partly determine the final facial dimensions. They also hint that the role of each muscle is different.}

The history of computerized facial approximation/reconstruction is presented, along with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies. Evaluation of the accuracy and reproducibility of these new systems is critical for the future of computerized facial reconstruction/approximation to become accepted by the wider forensic science field. In addition, constant re-evaluation and assessment will promote further improvement and increase reliability.},

Bach. This paper considers a facial reconstruction method (commonly known as the Manchester method) associated with the depiction and identification of the deceased from skeletal remains. Issues of artistic licence and scientific rigour, in relation to soft tissue reconstruction, anatomical variation and skeletal assessment, are discussed. The need for artistic interpretation is greatest where only skeletal material is available, particularly for the morphology of the ears and mouth, and with the skin for an ageing adult. The greatest accuracy is possible when information is available from preserved soft tissue, from a portrait, or from a pathological condition or healed injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer modeling system for facial reconstruction has been developed that employs a touch-based application to create anatomically accurate facial models focusing on skeletal detail. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the system and illustrates its accuracy and reliability with a blind study using computed tomography (CT) data of living individuals. Three-dimensional models of the skulls of two white North American adults (one male, one female) were imported into the computer system. Facial reconstructions were produced by two practitioners following the Manchester method. Two posters were produced, each including a face pool of five surface model images and the facial reconstruction. The face pool related to the sex, age, and ethnic group of the target individual and included the surface model image of the target individual. Fifty-two volunteers were asked to choose the face from the face pool that most resembled each reconstruction. Both reconstructions received majority percentage hit rates that were at least 50% greater than any other face in the pool. The combined percentage hit rate was 50% above chance (70%). A quantitative comparison of the facial morphology between the facial reconstructions and the CT scan models of the subjects was carried out using Rapidform 2004 PP2-RF4. The majority of the surfaces of the facial reconstructions showed less than 2.5 mm error and 90% of the male face and 75% of the female face showed less than 5 mm error. Many of the differences between the facial reconstructions and the facial scans were probably the result of positional effects caused during the CT scanning procedure, especially on the female subject who had a fatter face than the male subject. The areas of most facial reconstruction error were at the ears and nasal tip.}

  Abstract                 = {We recorded 3D coordinates for 28 mandibular landmarks from three-dimensional reconstructions of CT axial slices using the image analysis pro gram eTDIPS. The images were acquired from a pediatric series of human mandibles (neonate to 13 years of age) from the Bosma collection (Shapiro and Richtsmeier, 1997, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 103:415-416). To test the accuracy of these coordinate data, we recorded the same 28 landmarks directly on the Bosma mandibles using a Polhemus 3Space digitizer. The directly digitized landmarks serve as a gold standard upon which to evaluate the eTDIPS data. Standard deviations of landmark placement using eTDIPS show a greater degree of variation compared to the data gathered using the digitizer, although this error is more heavily concentrated in certain types, of landmarks. All possible linear distances between unique pairs of landmarks were calculated, and like linear distances were compared between the two data collection methods. The absolute difference for all like linear distances ranged from 0.001-3.9 mm (mean = 0.377 mm SD = 1.136), with the eTDIPS data being consistently larger than the digitizer coordinates. This study demonstrates that landmark coordinate data can be reliably collected from digital CT images of the human mandible. We define a set of mandibular landmarks useful in evaluating the effects of craniofacial disorders, growth and other biological processes. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This article employs a novel application of established geometric morphometric methods to examine shape differences in adult regional facial bone curvature with age. Three-dimensional semilandmarks representing the curvature of the orbits, zygomatic arches, nasal aperture, and maxillary alveolar process were collected from a cross-sectional cranial sample of mixed sex and ancestry (male and female; African- and European-American), partitioned into three age groups (young adult = 18-39; middle-aged = 40-59 years; and elderly = 60+ years). Each facial region's semilandmarks were aligned into a common coordinate system via generalized Procrustes superimposition. Regional variation in shape was then explored via a battery of multivariate statistical techniques. Age-related shape differences were detected in the orbits, zygomatic arches, and maxillary alveolar process. Interactions between age, sex, and ancestry were also identified. Vector plots revealed patterns of superoinferior compression, lateral expansion, and posterior recession depending on the population/subpopulation, location, and age groups examined. These findings indicate that adult craniofacial curvature shape is not static throughout human life. Instead, age-related spatial modifications occur in various regions of the craniofacial skeleton. Moreover, these regional alterations vary not only through time, but across human populations and the sexes. Am J Phys Anthropol 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The presented implementation depends primarily on the demands for research data management infrastructure by the funding research agency. It also aligns to theory and practice in Research Data Management (RDM) and e-Science. After the research project and related work in the field of RDM are introduced, a detailed description of the architecture and its implementation is given. The article discusses why Open Source and open standards are chosen to implement the infrastructure and provides some suggestions and examples on how to make it easier and more attractive for researchers to upload and publish their primary research data.},

  Abstract                 = {In comparing individual specimens with population samples, there may be many aspects of the comparison in which one is interested. One may wish to allocate the individual to one of the populations, or one may wish to calculate the atypicality of the individual with respect to each of the populations (based on Hotelling's T2) or one may wish to determine the (log-) odds of the individual belonging to one of two populations. As well, one may be interested in judging how likely it is that a single specimen may belong to one or more populations. So a distance measure is proposed, based on the dicrimination technique that determines more accurate and realistic (log-) odds estimates. This gives rise to a comparatively interactive, and exploratory, analysis of the data. Two examples are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Facial asymmetries are commonly used as a proxy for human developmental imprecision resulting from inbreeding, and thus reduced genetic heterozygosity. Several environmental factors influence human facial asymmetry (e.g., health care, parasites), but the generalizability of findings on genetic stressors has been limited in humans by sample characteristics (island populations, endogamy) and indirect genetic assessment (inference from pedigrees). In a sample of 3215 adult humans from the Rotterdam Study, we therefore studied the relationship of facial asymmetry, estimated from nine mid-facial landmarks, with genetic variation at 102 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci recently associated with facial shape variation. We further tested whether the degree of individual heterozygosity is negatively correlated with facial asymmetry. An ANOVA tree regression did not identify any SNP relating to either fluctuating asymmetry or total asymmetry. In a general linear model, only age and sex-but neither heterozygosity nor any SNP previously reported to covary with facial shape-was significantly related to total or fluctuating asymmetry of the midface. Our study does not corroborate the common assumption in evolutionary and behavioral biology that morphological asymmetries reflect heterozygosity. Our results, however, may be affected by a relatively small degree of inbreeding, a relatively stable environment, and an advanced age in the Rotterdam sample. Further large-scale genetic studies, including gene expression studies, are necessary to validate the genetic and developmental origin of morphological asymmetries.},

  Abstract                 = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

In contrast, to the north of the valley the Mousterian disappears shortly before the Proto-Aurignacian appears at ca. 42 ka calBP. The latter is most likely produced by anatomically modern humans. However, two-thirds of dates from the south are radiocarbon dates, a technique that is particularly sensitive to carbon contaminants of a younger age that can be difficult to remove using routine pretreatment protocols. We have attempted to test the reliability of chronologies of 11 southern Iberian Middle and early Upper Paleolithic sites. Only two, Jarama VI and Zafarraya, were found to contain material that could be reliably dated. In both sites, Middle Paleolithic contexts were previously dated by radiocarbon to less than 42 ka calBP. Using ultrafiltration to purify faunal bone collagen before radiocarbon dating, we obtain ages at least 10 ka 14C years older, close to or beyond the limit of the radiocarbon method for the Mousterian at Jarama VI and Neanderthal fossils at Zafarraya. Unless rigorous pretreatment protocols have been used, radiocarbon dates should be assumed to be inaccurate until proven otherwise in this region. Evidence for the late survival of Neanderthals in southern Iberia is limited to one possible site, Cueva Ant{\'o}n, and alternative models of human occupation of the region should be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Archaeological excavations and environmental archaeological studies over many years in the Shanghai Area have provided a wealth of information for Holocene environmental changes, growth and decline of human settlements and man{\^a}land interaction. Distribution of archaeological sites between 7000 and 3000 cal. yr BP indicates a regression process and a southward advance of the coastline in the study area. Temporal and spatial analyses of 14C dates for archaeological sites, shell ridges, buried trees, and peat suggest that Holocene environmental changes may well have been a major cause of the rise and fall of human settlements and their civilization. A relative sea-level curve of the Shanghai Area was derived from dated shell ridges and peat, and correlates well with the reconstructed sea-level curves of the Yangtze Delta and East China. The development of human settlements was interrupted at least four times in the Shanghai Area, matching four periods of high sea-level, peat accumulation, and increase in shell ridges, after which Neolithic communities moved onto the plain and reclaimed their lowlands for rice cultivation. The Chenier Ridges played an important role in sheltering the Neolithic settlers. The collapse of Liangzhu Culture about 4000 cal. yr BP was followed by the less-developed Maqiao Culture. These studies suggest that extreme environmental and hydrological conditions such as terrestrial inundation caused by sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, contributed to the cessation of paddy exploitation and to the social stress that led to the Liangzhu Culture demise.},

The colon was extracted from volumetric data sets generated from transverse CT sections. Volumetric features characterizing polyps were computed at each point in the extracted colon. Polyps were detected by means of hysteresis thresholding and fuzzy clustering followed by a rule-based test on the basis of feature values. Locations of the detected polyps were compared with those detected at conventional colonoscopy.RESULTS: Forty-one cases were analyzed: nine cases with polyps and 32 without polyps. Each case with polyps had one polyp of clinically important size (six were 5-9 mm; three, 10 mm). Thus, there were 82 volumetric data sets, 18 included polyps. Eighty-nine percent (16 of 18) of the polyps were detected. Each of the two false-negative findings was detected in the other position; thus, 100% of polyp cases were detected, with 2.5 false-positive findings per patient. The false-positive findings were similar to those due to common perceptual errors. Most of the false-positive findings were easily distinguishable from true polyps by experienced radiologists.CONCLUSION: The CAD scheme has the potential to depict polyps with high sensitivity and an acceptable false-positive rate.},

  Abstract                 = {A new approach for constructing deformable continuous medial models for anatomical structures is presented. Medial models describe geometrical objects by first specifying the skeleton of the object and then deriving the boundary surface corresponding to the skeleton. However, an arbitrary specification of a skeleton will not be "valid" unless a certain set of sufficient conditions is satisfied. The most challenging of these is the non-linear equality constraint that must hold along the boundaries of the manifolds forming the skeleton. The main contribution of this paper is to leverage the biharmonic partial differential equation as a mapping from a codimension-0 subset of Euclidean space to the space of skeletons that satisfy the equality constraint. The PDE supports robust numerical solution on freeform triangular meshes, providing additional flexibility for shape modeling. The approach is evaluated by generating continuous medial models for a large dataset of hippocampus shapes. Generalizations to modeling more complex shapes and to representing branching skeletons are demonstrated.},

Since the clinical impression can be misleading, dysmorphic features should be validated by quantitative criteria wherever possible. Anthropometric measurements have been used in the characterization of many dysmorphic syndromes. However, data on normal craniofacial measurements is sparse and incomplete. In this study, we present normal values for nose size and philtrum length based on measurements on 2,500 healthy individuals of central European origin, ranging in age from zero to 97 years. {\^A}© 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {The geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in complex biological structures such as the human skull poses a number of specific challenges: the registration of homologous morphologies, the treatment of bilateral symmetry, the graphical representation of form variability in three dimensions and the interpretation of the results in terms of differential growth processes. To visualize complex patterns of shape change, we propose an alternative to classical Cartesian deformation grids in the style of D'Arcy W. Thompson. Reference to the surface structures of the organism under investigation permits a comprehensive visual grasp of shape change and its tentative interpretation in terms of differential growth. The application of this method to the analysis of human craniofacial shape variation reveals distinct modes of growth and development of the neurocranial and viscerocranial regions of the skull. Our data further indicate that variations in the orientation of the viscerocranium relative to the neurocranium impinge on the shapes of the face and the cranial vault.},
