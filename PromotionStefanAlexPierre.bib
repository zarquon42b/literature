  abstract = {Many evolutionary studies require an understanding of phenotypic change.
	However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary
	levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods
	for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across
	multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical
	procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution.
	The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory
	across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space.
	Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape),
	are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa,
	and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which
	patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa.
	This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns
	of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment
	of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection
	among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic
	trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose
	data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including:
	phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth,
	local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by
	examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of
	Globorotalia.},

  abstract = {Character displacement is typically identified by comparing phenotypic
	differences in sympatry and allopatry. Recently, however, Goldberg
	and Lande (2006) pointed out that when phenotypic characters vary
	along an environmental gradient, the standard approach may fail to
	identify sympatric character divergence. Here we present a general
	analytical procedure for identifying sympatric character divergence
	while accounting for phenotypic changes that covary with environmental
	variables. Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized
	linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric
	phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting
	for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we
	demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric
	character divergence when they are present, and does not identify
	such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements
	and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing
	a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character
	displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for
	other covariates and sources of variation.},

  abstract = {A conceptual framework that allows faces to be studied and compared
	objectively with biological validity is presented. The framework
	is a logical extension of modern morphometrics and statistical shape
	analysis techniques. Three dimensional (3D) facial scans were collected
	from 255 healthy young adults. One scan depicted a smiling facial
	expression and another scan depicted a neutral expression. These
	facial scans were modelled in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	space where Euclidean (ED) and Mahalanobis (MD) distances were used
	to form similarity measures. Within this PCA space, property pathways
	were calculated that expressed the direction of change in facial
	expression. Decomposition of distances into property-independent
	(D1) and dependent components (D2) along these pathways enabled the
	comparison of two faces in terms of the extent of a smiling expression.
	The performance of all distances was tested and compared in dual
	types of experiments: Classification tasks and a Recognition task.
	In the Classification tasks, individual facial scans were assigned
	to one or more population groups of smiling or neutral scans. The
	property-dependent (D2) component of both Euclidean and Mahalanobis
	distances performed best in the Classification task, by correctly
	assigning 99.8% of scans to the right population group. The recognition
	task tested if a scan of an individual depicting a smiling/neutral
	expression could be positively identified when shown a scan of the
	same person depicting a neutral/smiling expression. ED1 and MD1 performed
	best, and correctly identified 97.8% and 94.8% of individual scans
	respectively as belonging to the same person despite differences
	in facial expression. It was concluded that decomposed components
	are superior to straightforward distances in achieving positive identifications
	and presents a novel method for quantifying facial similarity. Additionally,
	although the undecomposed Mahalanobis distance often used in practice
	outperformed that of the Euclidean, it was the opposite result for
	the decomposed distances.},

  abstract = {Variation in cranial robusticity among modern human populations is
	widely acknowledged but not well-understood. While the use of ldquorobustrdquo
	cranial traits in hominin systematics and phylogeny suggests that
	these characters are strongly heritable, this hypothesis has not
	been tested. Alternatively, cranial robusticity may be a response
	to differences in diet/mastication or it may be an adaptation to
	cold, harsh environments. This study quantifies the distribution
	of cranial robusticity in 14 geographically widespread human populations,
	and correlates this variation with climatic variables, neutral genetic
	distances, cranial size, and cranial shape. With the exception of
	the occipital torus region, all traits were positively correlated
	with each other, suggesting that they should not be treated as individual
	characters. While males are more robust than females within each
	of the populations, among the independent variables (cranial shape,
	size, climate, and neutral genetic distances), only shape is significantly
	correlated with inter-population differences in robusticity. Two-block
	partial least-squares analysis was used to explore the relationship
	between cranial shape (captured by three-dimensional landmark data)
	and robusticity across individuals. Weak support was found for the
	hypothesis that robusticity was related to mastication as the shape
	associated with greater robusticity was similar to that described
	for groups that ate harder-to-process diets. Specifically, crania
	with more prognathic faces, expanded glabellar and occipital regions,
	and (slightly) longer skulls were more robust than those with rounder
	vaults and more orthognathic faces. However, groups with more mechanically
	demanding diets (hunter-gatherers) were not always more robust than
	groups practicing some form of agriculture. Am J Phys Anthropol,

  abstract = {Facial heights, i.e. the vertical distances between the superior and
	inferior limits of facial compartments, contribute to the orientation
	of the viscerocranium in the primate skull. In humans, vertical facial
	variation is among the main sources of diversity and frequently associated
	with an integrated suite of other cranio-mandibular traits. Facial
	heights and kyphosis are also important factors in interspecific
	variation and models of hominoid evolution. The ontogenctic determination
	of adult facial orientation and its relation to phylogenetic variation
	are unclear, but crucial in all previously mentioned respects. We
	addressed these issues in a sample of 175 humans and chimpanzees
	with Procrustes based geometric morphometrics, testing hypotheses
	of interspecific similarity in postnatal ontogenetic trajectories,
	early versus later ontogenetic facial pattern determination, and
	a developmental model of morphological integration. We analyzed the
	contribution of postnatal morphogenesis to adult vertical facial
	variation by partitioning morphological variation into a portion
	of pure growth allometry and a non-allometric, fraction. A statistically
	significant difference of growth-allometries revealed that in both
	species growth established the adult skull proportions by vertical
	facial expansion, but while in chimpanzees the complete viscerocranium
	showed reorientation, in humans only the lower face was modified.
	In both species the results support a hypothesis of early facial
	pattern determination. A coincident emergence of morphological traits
	favors a hypothesis of developmental integration of the face, excluding
	traits of the basi- and neurocranium. Interspecific differences in
	integration may have implications for evolutionary studies. The present
	findings indicate that growth establishes the adult skull proportions
	and integrates principal facial orientation patterns, already there
	in early postnatal ontogeny. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Human populations across the world vary greatly in cranial morphology.
	It is highly debated to what extent this variability has accumulated
	through neutral processes (genetic drift) or through natural selection
	driven by climate. By taking advantage of recent work showing that
	geographic distance along landmasses is an excellent proxy for neutral
	genetic differentiation, we quantify the relative role of drift versus
	selection in an exceptionally large dataset of human skulls. We show
	that neutral processes have been much more important than climate
	in shaping the human cranium. We further demonstrate that a large
	proportion of the signal for natural selection comes from populations
	from extremely cold regions. More generally, we show that, if drift
	is not explicitly accounted for, the effect of natural selection
	can be greatly overestimated. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss,

	in the inner median-sagittal profile, the shape remained remarkably
	stable over all 21 specimens. This implies that no significant alteration
	in this region has taken place over a period of a half-million years
	or more of evolution, even as considerable external change occurred
	within the hominid clade spanning several species. This confirms
	that the forms of the inner and outer aspects of the human frontal
	bone are determined by entirely independent factors, and further
	indicates unexpected stability in anterior brain morphology over
	the period during which modern human cognitive capacities emerged.

  abstract = {At the core of contemporary morphometrics--the quantitative study
	of biological shape variation--is a synthesis of two originally divergent
	methodological styles. One contributory tradition is the multivariate
	analysis of covariance matrices originally developed as biometrics
	and now dominant across a broad expanse of applied statistics. This
	approach, couched solely in the linear geometry of covariance structures,
	ignores biomathematical aspects of the original measurements. The
	other tributary emphasizes the direct visualization of changes in
	biological form. However, making objective the biological meaning
	of the features seen in those diagrams was always problematical;
	also, the representation of variation, as distinct from pairwise
	difference, proved infeasible. To combine these two variants of biomathematical
	modeling into a valid praxis for quantitative studies of biological
	shape was a goal earnestly sought though most of this century. That
	goal was finally achieved in the 1980s when techniques from mathematical
	statistics, multivariate biometrics, non-Euclidean geometry and computer
	graphics were combined in a coherent new system of tools for the
	complete regionalized quantitative analysis of landmark points together
	with the biomedical images in which they are seen. In this morphometric
	synthesis, correspondence of landmarks (biologically labeled geometric
	points, like "bridge of the nose") across specimens is taken as a
	biomathematical primitive. The shapes of configurations of landmarks
	are defined as equivalence classes with respect to the Euclidean
	similarity group and then represented as single points in David Kendall's
	shape space, a Riemannian manifold with Procrustes distance as metric.
	All conventional multivariate strategies carry over to the study
	of shape variation and covariation when shapes are interpreted in
	the tangent space to the shape manifold at an average shape. For
	biomathematical interpretation of such analyses, one needs a basis
	for the tangent space compatible with the reality of local biotheoretical
	processes and explanations at many different geometric scales, and
	one needs graphics for visualizing average shape differences and
	other statistical contrasts there. Both of these needs are managed
	by the thin-plate spline, a deformation function that has an unusually
	helpful linear algebra. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks
	to deformation analysis of the images from which the landmarks originally
	arose. This article reviews the history and principal tools of this
	synthesis in their biomathematical and biometrical context and demonstrates
	their usefulness in a study of focal neuroanatomical anomalies in
	schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {In many current medical applications of image analysis, objects are
	detected and delimited 
	
	by boundary curves or surfaces. Yet the most effective multivariate
	statistics available pertain to 
	
	labeled points (landmarks) only. In the finite-dimensional feature
	space that landmarks support, 
	
	each case of a data set is equivalent to a deformation map deriving
	it from the average form. This 
	
	paper introduces a new extension of the finite-dimensional spline-based
	approach for incorporating 
	
	edge information. In this implementation edgels are restricted to
	landmark loci: they are interpreted 
	
	as pairs of landmarks at infinitesimal separation in a specific direction.
	The effect of changing edge 
	
	direction is a singular perturbation of the thin-plate spline for
	the landmarks alone. An appropriate 
	
	normalization yields a basis for image deformations corresponding
	to changes of edge direction 
	
	without landmark movement; this basis complements the basis of landmark
	deformations ignoring 
	
	edge information. We derive explicit formulas for these edge warps,
	evaluate the quadratic form 
	
	expressing bending energies of their formal combinations, and show
	the resulting spectrum of edge 
	
	features in typical scenes. These expressions will aid all investigations
	into medical images that entail

	have typically been diagnosed with either fetal alcohol syndrome
	(FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE), depending on facial features.
	There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups.
	We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive
	and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the
	variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline
	curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions
	from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15
	with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5
	h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings
	pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross
	motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed
	by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior
	by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly
	more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With
	the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles
	of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE
	distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum
	is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one
	that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two
	combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed
	from the unexposed in this sample. Thus there is considerable information
	in callosal form for prognosis of neuropsychological deficits in
	this frequently encountered birth defect.},

	artists and plastic surgeons. Since ancient times, many rules have
	been proposed for the ideal face. The authors measured directly vertical
	and horizontal proportions of the face and inclinations of the soft-tissue
	facial profile in 1050 young Turkish adults. Differences between
	the facial measurements of subjects from seven different geographic
	regions were analyzed. Some of the measurements were compared further
	with the measurements of other populations in the literature, and
	the validity of the neoclassical canons were tested. The special
	head height measure was shorter than the special face height in the
	majority of our study group (women/men: equal height, 13%/15%; longer
	special head height, 28%/30%; shorter special head height, 59%/55%).
	Faces with three equally high-profile sections were not seen in women
	or in men. When the forehead height was compared with the nose height,
	equality was present in a small percentage of the population (women/men:
	equal height, 17%/18%; longer forehead, 41%/42%; shorter forehead,
	42%/40%). The nose height was equal to the lower face height in a
	minority of the population (women/men: equal height, 10%/11%; longer
	nose, 9%/11%; shorter nose (81%/78%). The forehead height was shorter
	than the lower face height in the majority of the population (women/men:
	equal height, 8%/9%; longer forehead, 12%/13%; shorter forehead,
	79%/78%). The intercanthal distance was shorter than the nose width
	in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width, 20%/19%;
	wider intercanthal distance, 35%/37%; narrower intercanthal width,
	65%/68%). The population was distributed evenly in regard to the
	variations of the orbital proportion canon (women/men: equal intercanthal
	width and eye fissure length, 31%/36%; wider intercanthal distance,
	34%/27%; narrower intercanthal width, 35%/37%). The mouth width was
	greater than 1.5 times the nose width in the majority of the population
	(women/men: equal width, 6%/5%; wider mouth, 53%/54%; narrower mouth,
	41%/41%). The nose width was narrower than one quarter of the face
	width in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width,
	4%/3%; wider nose, 30%/39%; narrower nose, 66%/58%). The nose inclination
	was equal to the ear inclination in a very small fraction of subjects
	(women/men: equal inclination, 3%/3%; greater nose inclination, 88%/87%;
	less nose inclination, 9%/9%). To sketch an outline of the average
	facial profile in the population studied, a convex facial profile
	is revealed, with the forehead and the chin retrodisplaced minimally
	with respect to the midface. The neoclassical canons were found to
	be invalid for the majority of the population in this study, and
	different proportional analytic results were obtained.},

  abstract = {The present brief review is a survey of the role of forensic anthropology
	(FA) in the new millennium. After an introduction which deals with
	the expanding definition of the discipline and the issue of professionality
	and training, the author approaches the role and novel developments
	of the field, with particular reference to the past 5 years. Such
	developments are discussed in a sectorial manner, distinguishing
	the role of research in the areas of forensic anthropology which
	deal with human remains and those that deal with the living. As regards
	the "human remains" domain, advances and stalls still present in
	the fields of species and postmortem interval determination, sexing,
	aging and attribution of ancestry are stressed. The need for standards

	associated with an unidentified skull specimen. Estimation is generally
	based on tabulated average values of soft tissue thicknesses measured
	at a sparse set of landmarks on the skull. Traditional [`]plastic'
	methods apply modeling clay or plasticine on a cast of the skull,
	approximating the estimated tissue depths at the landmarks and interpolating
	in between. Current computerized techniques mimic this landmark interpolation
	procedure using a single static facial surface template. However,
	the resulting reconstruction is biased by the specific choice of
	the template and no face-specific regularization is used during the
	interpolation process. We reduce the template bias by using a flexible
	statistical model of a dense set of facial surface points, combined
	with an associated sparse set of skull-based landmarks. This statistical
	model is constructed from a facial database of (N = 118) individuals
	and limits the reconstructions to statistically plausible outlooks.
	The actual reconstruction is obtained by fitting the skull-based
	landmarks of the template model to the corresponding landmarks indicated
	on a digital copy of the skull to be reconstructed. The fitting process
	changes the face-specific statistical model parameters in a regularized
	way and interpolates the remaining landmark fit error using a minimal
	bending thin-plate spline (TPS)-based deformation. Furthermore, estimated
	properties of the skull specimen (BMI, age and gender, e.g.) can
	be incorporated as conditions on the reconstruction by removing property-related
	shape variation from the statistical model description before the
	fitting process. The proposed statistical method is validated, both
	in terms of accuracy and identification success rate, based on leave-one-out
	cross-validation tests applied on the facial database. Accuracy results
	are obtained by statistically analyzing the local 3D facial surface
	differences of the reconstructions and their corresponding ground
	truth. Identification success rate is obtained by comparing, based
	on correlation, Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) signatures of the
	reconstructed and the original 3D facial surfaces in the database.
	A subjective identification success rate is quantified based on face-pool
	tests. Finally a qualitative comparison is made between facial reconstructions
	of a real-case skull, based on two typical static face models and
	our statistical model, showing the shortcomings of current face models
	and the improved performance of the statistical model.},

	Computerized CFR techniques are essentially a virtual mimicking of
	manual CFR techniques and all share the same conceptual model-based
	framework. We propose a fully automated Bayesian based statistical
	framework estimating the most probable face, according to a known
	craniofacial model (CFM), given the, possibly inaccurate, skull data.
	A multivariate Gaussian distribution is assumed for the shape parameters
	of the CFM, only allowing face-like solutions. The CFM is improved
	by encoding tissue depth differently as an extra value for 52 landmarks
	on the face and by incorporating gray-valued texture information.
	A fully automated and consistent technique is obtained by the use
	of an implicit target skull representation (TSR). The most plausible
	face associated to the target skull is calculated using an expectation-maximization
	procedure that is robust to small (noise) and/or gross errors (outliers).
	A clinical database of 12 individuals is used for simulating realistic
	reconstruction scenarios. Validation is performed in terms of reconstruction
	accuracy and recognition success. Within the same EM reconstruction
	framework, the proposed procedure is compared to alternative reconstructions
	using different target skull representations and different CFMs incorporating
	various amounts of covariance. The results indicate that the proposed
	CFM performs better than the other models. Furthermore, the use of
	the implicit TSR generates more consistent and better results compared
	to a realistic landmark based skull representation. Finally, these
	results also confirm that the Bayesian framework formulation is indeed
	robust against noise and outliers in the skull data.},

  abstract = {Analyses of two-state phenotypic change are common in ecological research.
	Some examples include phenotypic changes due to phenotypic plasticity
	between two environments, changes due to predator/non-predator character
	shifts, character displacement via competitive interactions, and
	patterns of sexual dimorphism. However, methods for analyzing phenotypic
	change for multivariate data have not been rigorously developed.
	Here we outline a method for testing vectors of phenotypic change
	in terms of two important attributes: the magnitude of change (vector
	length) and the direction of change described by trait covariation
	(angular difference between vectors). We describe a permutation procedure
	for testing these attributes, which allows non-targeted sources of
	variation to be held constant. We provide examples that illustrate
	the importance of considering vector attributes of phenotypic change
	in biological studies, and we demonstrate how greater inference can
	be made than by evaluating variance components with MANOVA alone.
	Finally, we consider how our method may be extended to more complex
	data.},

  abstract = {A large-scale study of facial soft tissue depths of Caucasian adults
	was conducted. Over a 2-years period, 967 Caucasian subjects of both
	sexes, varying age and varying body mass index (BMI) were studied.
	A user-friendly and mobile ultrasound-based system was used to measure,
	in about 20 min per subject, the soft tissue thickness at 52 facial
	landmarks including most of the landmarks used in previous studies.
	This system was previously validated on repeatability and accuracy
	[S. De Greef, P. Claes, W. Mollemans, M. Loubele, D. Vandermeulen,
	P. Suetens, G. Willems, Semi-automated ultrasound facial soft tissue
	depth registration: method and validation. J. Forensic Sci. 50 (2005)].
	The data of 510 women and 457 men were analyzed in order to update
	facial soft tissue depth charts of the contemporary Caucasian adult.
	Tables with the average thickness values for each landmark as well
	as the standard deviation and range, tabulated according to gender,
	age and BMI are reported. In addition, for each landmark and for
	both sexes separately, a multiple linear regression of thickness
	versus age and BMI is calculated. The lateral asymmetry of the face
	was analysed on an initial subset of 588 subjects showing negligible
	differences and thus warranting the unilateral measurements of the
	remaining subjects. The new dataset was statistically compared to
	three datasets for the Caucasian adults: the traditional datasets
	of Rhine and Moore [J.S. Rhine, C.E. Moore, Tables of facial tissue
	thickness of American Caucasoids in forensic anthropology. Maxwell
	Museum Technical series 1 (1984)] and Helmer [R. Helmer, Schädelidentifizierung
	durch elektronische bildmischung, Kriminalistik Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg,
	1984] together with the most recent in vivo study by Manhein et al.
	[M.H. Manhein, G.A. Listi, R.E. Barsley, R. Musselman, N.E. Barrow,
	D.H. Ubelbaker, In vivo facial tissue depth measurements for children
	and adults. J. Forensic Sci. 45 (2000) 48-60]. The large-scale database
	presented in this paper offers a denser sampling of the facial soft
	tissue depths of a more representative subset of the actual Caucasian
	population over the different age and body posture subcategories.
	This database can be used as an updated chart for manual and computer-based
	craniofacial approximation and allows more refined analyses of the
	possible factors affecting facial soft tissue depth.},

	and of the mandibular bone as a whole, in response to external loading
	is discussed. A survey is given of the determinants of mandibular
	stiffness and strength, including the mechanical properties and distribution
	of bone tissue and the size and shape of the mandible. Mandibular
	deformations, stresses, and strains that occur during static biting
	and chewing are reviewed. During biting and the powerstroke of mastication,
	a combination of sagittal bending, corpus rotation, and transverse
	bending occurs. The result is a complex pattern of stresses and strains
	(compressive, tensile, shear, torsional) in the mandible. To be able
	to resist forces and bending and torsional moments, not only the
	material properties of the mandible but also its geometrical design
	is of importance. This is reflected by variables like polar and maximum
	and minimum moments of inertia and the relative amount and distribution
	of bone tissue. In the longitudinal direction, the mandible is stiffer
	than in transverse directions, and the vertical cross-sectional dimension
	of the mandible is larger than its transverse dimension. These features
	enhance the resistance of the mandible to the relatively large vertical
	shear forces and bending moments that come into play in the sagittal
	plane.},

	cell phone cameras, surveillance video systems, webcams, and traditional
	film and broadcast video. As a result, law enforcement and intelligence
	agencies have numerous opportunities to acquire and analyze images
	that depict persons of interest. Computer-Aided Forensic Facial Comparison
	is a comprehensive exploration of the scientific, technical, and
	statistical challenges facing researchers investigating courtroom
	identification from facial images.
	
	
	Supported by considerable background material, research data, and
	prototypic statistical and applications software, this volume brings
	together contributions from anthropologists, computer scientists,
	forensic scientists, and statisticians. Topics discussed include:
	
	
	 * Face database collection in 3D
	
	 * Error and distinguishing power associated with craniofacial landmarks
	
	 * Statistical analysis of face shape variation
	
	 * Comparison of instrumentation
	
	 * Court admissibility issues
	
	 * Missing data
	
	 * Computer applications development
	
	
	Based on the quantification and analysis of more than 3000 facial
	images, this seminal work lays the foundation for future forensic
	facial comparison, computer applications development, and research
	in face shape variation and analysis. Using experimental and real
	case data, it demonstrates the influence of illumination, image resolution,
	perspective, and pose angle on landmark visibility. Two DVDs are
	included which contain the raw 3D landmark datasets for 3000 faces,
	additional datasets used in 2D analysis, and computer programs and
	spreadsheets used in analysis and in the development of prototypic
	applications software.},

  abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics and form the
	foundation of a vast range of statistical methodologies. Julian J.
	Faraway's critically acclaimed Linear Models with R examined regression
	and analysis of variance, demonstrated the different methods available,
	and showed in which situations each one applies. Following in those
	footsteps, Extending the Linear Model with R surveys the techniques
	that grow from the regression model, presenting three extensions
	to that framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect
	models, and nonparametric regression models. The author's treatment
	is thoroughly modern and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics,
	generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the use of neural
	networks in statistics. To demonstrate the interplay of theory and
	practice, throughout the book the author weaves the use of the R
	software environment to analyze the data of real examples, providing
	all of the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses. A supporting
	Web site at www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/ELM holds all of the
	data described in the book. Statisticians need to be familiar with
	a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book provides a well-stocked
	toolbox of methodologies, and with its unique presentation of these
	very modern statistical techniques, holds the potential to break
	new ground in the way graduate-level courses in this area are taught.},

  abstract = {Books on regression and the analysis of variance abound-many are introductory,
	many are theoretical. While most of them do serve a purpose, the
	fact remains that data analysis cannot be properly learned without
	actually doing it, and this means using a statistical software package.
	There are many of these to choose from as well, all with their particular
	strengths and weaknesses. Lately, however, one such package has begun
	to rise above the others thanks to its free availability, its versatility
	as a programming language, and its interactivity. That software is
	R. In the first book that directly uses R to teach data analysis,
	Linear Models with R focuses on the practice of regression and analysis
	of variance. It clearly demonstrates the different methods available
	and more importantly, in which situations each one applies. It covers
	all of the standard topics, from the basics of estimation to missing
	data, factorial designs, and block designs, but it also includes
	discussion on topics, such as model uncertainty, rarely addressed
	in books of this type. The presentation incorporates an abundance
	of examples that clarify both the use of each technique and the conclusions
	one can draw from the results. All of the data sets used in the book
	are available for download from http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/LMR/.
	The author assumes that readers know the essentials of statistical
	inference and have a basic knowledge of data analysis, linear algebra,
	and calculus. The treatment reflects his view of statistical theory
	and his belief that qualitative statistical concepts, while somewhat
	more difficult to learn, are just as important because they enable
	us to practice statistics rather than just talk about it.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to gain information about normal sex-related
	linear and angular dimensions of the orbital region; left-right symmetry;
	and growth changes between adolescence and mid-adulthood. The three-dimensional
	coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the orbits and face
	were obtained by an electromagnetic digitizer in 40 male and 33 female
	adolescents aged 12 to 15 years, 73 female and 89 male young adults
	aged 19 to 30 years, and 41 male and 38 female adults aged 31 to
	56 years. From the landmarksbinocular and intercanthal widths; paired
	height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal
	(head in natural head position) and Frankfurt plane; length and inclination
	of the eye fissure; and the orbital height to eye fissure length
	ratio were calculated and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were
	performed by factorial analysis of variance. Both the linear dimensions
	and the angular values were significantly larger in male subjects
	than in female subjects of corresponding age (p < 0.05). A significant
	effect of age was found (p < 0.05): while the linear distances and
	the orbital height-to-length ratio were greater in older people of
	the same sex, the inclination of the eye fissure decreased as a function
	of age. Both orbital inclinations were larger in the young adult
	group than in the adolescent and middle-aged groups. On average,
	the paired measurements were symmetrical, with similar values within
	each sex and age group. Data collected in this investigation could
	serve as a database for the quantitative description of human orbital
	morphology during normal adolescent and adult growth},

  abstract = {The analysis of mandibular growth changes around the pubertal spurt
	in humans has several important implications for the diagnosis and
	orthopedic correction of skeletal disharmonies. The purpose of this
	study was to evaluate mandibular shape and size growth changes around
	the pubertal spurt in a longitudinal sample of subjects with normal
	occlusion by means of an appropriate morphometric technique (thin-plate
	spline analysis). Ten mandibular landmarks were identified on lateral
	cephalograms of 29 subjects at 6 different developmental phases.
	The 6 phases corresponded to 6 different maturational stages in cervical
	vertebrae during accelerative and decelerative phases of the pubertal
	growth curve of the mandible. Differences in shape between average
	mandibular configurations at the 6 developmental stages were visualized
	by means of thin-plate spline analysis and subjected to permutation
	test. Centroid size was used as the measure of the geometric size
	of each mandibular specimen. Differences in size at the 6 developmental
	phases were tested statistically. The results of graphical analysis
	indicated a statistically significant change in mandibular shape
	only for the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical
	vertebral maturation. Significant increases in centroid size were
	found at all developmental phases, with evidence of a prepubertal
	minimum and of a pubertal maximum. The existence of a pubertal peak
	in human mandibular growth, therefore, is confirmed by thin-plate
	spline analysis. Significant morphological changes in the mandible
	during the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical vertebral
	maturation may be described as an upward-forward direction of condylar
	growth determining an overall "shrinkage" of the mandibular configuration
	along the measurement of total mandibular length. This biological
	mechanism is particularly efficient in compensating for major increments
	in mandibular size at the adolescent spurt.}

	Linear measurements were obtained using mathematically transformed,

	of the transformed linear data were made with those in a traditional

	Johannesburg) on similar samples and equivalent landmarks. Comparisons
	were not made with her Penrose (Ann Eugenics 18 (1954) 337) analysis
	as an apparently anomalous shapesize statistic was found. The
	univariate comparisons demonstrated that accurate linear measurements
	could be derived from three-dimensional data, showing that it is
	possible to simultaneously obtain data for three-dimensional geometric
	shape and linear inter-landmark analyses.
	
	Using Penrose and canonical variates analyses of the transformed three-dimensional
	inter-landmark measurements, similar population distances were found
	for the four indigenous southern African populations. The inter-population
	distance relationships took the form of three separated pairs of
	distances, with the within-pair distances very similar in size. The
	cranial features of the four populations were found to be overall
	very similar morphometrically. However the populations were each
	shown by CVA to have population specific features, and using discriminant
	analyses 50% or more of the individual crania (with the exception
	of the Sotho) could be referred to their correct populations.}

	Nine linear measurements, obtained from mathematically transformed

  abstract = {Sex estimation of skeletal remains is an important issue in both forensics
	and bioarchaeology. The chance of attaining a high level of accuracy
	regarding sex allocations is related to the skeletal component analyzed
	and the ability of the techniques employed to describe shape and
	size differences among the sexes. Current opinion regards the hip
	bone as the most reliable sex indicator because it is the most dimorphic
	bone, particularly in adult individuals. The aim of this study was
	therefore to analyze the greater sciatic notch and the ischiopubic
	complex morphology by employing geometric morphometric techniques,
	based on semilandmark and multivariate statistical methods, in order
	to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation.
	The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly
	selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the
	Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on
	coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic
	regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant
	analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering
	of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify
	individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy
	of 90.9\% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape
	variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with
	shape variables were 93.4\% and 90.1\% for discriminant and k-means,
	respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males,
	especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical
	analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages
	of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape
	variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and
	multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape
	differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate
	between females and males.},

  abstract = {Consider a binary image containing one or more objects. A signed distance
	transform assigns to each pixel (voxel, etc.), both inside and outside
	of any objects, the minimum distance from that pixel to the nearest
	pixel on the border of an object. By convention, the sign of the
	assigned distance value indicates whether or not the point is within
	some object (positive) or outside of all objects (negative). Over
	the years, many different algorithms have been proposed to calculate
	the distance transform of an image. These algorithms often trade
	accuracy for efficiency, exhibit varying degrees of conceptual complexity,
	and some require parallel processors. One algorithm in particular,
	the Chamfer distance [J. ACM 15 (1968) 600, Comput. Vis. Graph. Image
	Process. 34 (1986) 344], has been analyzed for accuracy, is relatively
	efficient, requires no special computing hardware, and is conceptually
	straightforward. It is understandably, therefore, quite popular and
	widely used. We present a straightforward modification to the Chamfer
	distance transform algorithm that allows it to produce more accurate
	results without increasing the window size. We call this new algorithm
	Dead Reckoning as it is loosely based on the concept of continual
	measurements and course correction that was employed by ocean going
	vessel navigation in the past. We compare Dead Reckoning with a wide
	variety of other distance transform algorithms based on the Chamfer
	distance algorithm for both accuracy and speed, and demonstrate that
	Dead Reckoning produces more accurate results with comparable efficiency.},

  journal = {Am. J. Phys. Anthropol.},
  year = {2010},
  pages = {n/a--n/a},
  abstract = {Abstract The modern human mandibular symphysis differs from those
	of all other primates in being vertically orientated and possessing
	a chin, but the functional significance of this unique morphology
	is not well understood. Some hypotheses propose that it is an adaptation
	to specific loads occurring during masticatory function. This study
	uses finite element analysis to examine these symphyseal loads in
	a model of a modern human mandible. By modifying the symphyseal cross-sectional
	form, the mechanical significance of the presence of the chin and
	symphyseal orientation is tested, and modern human and Neanderthal
	symphyseal cross-sections are compared with regard to their ability
	to withstand different loads. The results show that changes in symphyseal
	form have profound effects on the strains. The presence of a chin
	leads to lower symphyseal strains overall, whereas a vertical orientation
	of the symphysis results in higher strains under wishboning, but
	not under vertical bending in the coronal plane and dorsoventral
	shear. Compared to Neanderthals, the modern human symphysis shows
	higher strains during dorsoventral shear and wishboning, but is as
	effective as the Neanderthal symphysis in resisting vertical bending
	in the coronal plane and the loads resulting from simulated incision
	and unilateral molar biting. In general, the results of this study
	corroborate prior hypotheses about the mechanical effects of the
	human chin and vertical symphyseal orientation and support the idea
	that the relative importance of wishboning and vertical bending in
	the coronal plane might have played a role in the evolution of modern
	human symphyseal morphology. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss,

  abstract = {The thin plate splines (TPS) has been applied to landmark-based elastic
	image registration. However, TPS forces the corresponding landmarks
	to exactly match each other, which is problematic when the localization
	of landmarks is prone to some error. Approximating TPS (ATPS) has
	been proposed to weak the interpolation condition. In ATPS, the regularization
	parameter plays an important role. It controls the smoothness of
	the transformation. Unfortunately, how to estimate is not solved.
	In this paper, estimation of the optimal regularization parameter
	has been proposed. It combines two evaluation factors, smoothness
	and location error hypothesis testing, to evaluate transformation
	results using fuzzy integral. The optimal regularization parameter
	is the best value maximizing the evaluation function. Experiments
	of the artificial grids and medial images show that our technique
	is feasible.},

  abstract = {The people associated with the Jomon culture, the Neolithic inhabitants
	of Japan, are one of the key groups in the population history of
	East Asia, because they retain many archaic characters that may be
	traced back to Eurasian Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. In this
	study, the regional diversity of the Jomon skeletal series was estimated
	by applying the R-matrix method to 34 craniofacial measurements.
	The patterns of intraregional variation indicate little effect on
	the genetic structure of the Jomon from long-term gene flow stemming
	from an outside source. The regional diversities were further estimated
	by pooling all individuals into regional aggregates, and by computing
	the mean variance within local groups in each region. Although the
	pattern of phenotypic variation differs depending on the unit of
	analysis, the gradient of the diversity retains its identity. The
	Hokkaido region, the northernmost part of the Japanese archipelago,
	has the highest variance, followed by the regions of eastern Japan,
	while the southwestern regions have the lowest variance. These findings
	suggest that the Jomon ancestors of the northern part of Japan might
	have expanded southward to Honshu Island. Global analyses including
	samples from Eurasia, Africa, and Australia dating roughly to the
	same chronological periods as those of the Jomon samples, indicate
	that the Jomon cranial series share part of their ancestral gene
	pool with early northeastern Asians. The present findings support
	the archeologically suggested population growth and expansion in
	the northern half of the Eurasian continent during the late Pleistocene
	and early Holocene periods. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2009. © 2008 Wiley-Liss,

	63 women) between the age of 18 and 25 years (mean, 22.7 y) in PR
	China was obtained for this study. By the guidance of standard methods,
	based on Farkas's anthropometric measurements in craniofacial region,
	12 nasal soft tissue landmarks and 12 linear and 3 angular measurements
	were chosen. The linear measurements were taken directly, whereas
	the angular measurements were taken by photogrammetric method. Eight
	nasal proportion indices were calculated according to the linear
	measurements. The application of the independent-samples t-test showed
	sex dimorphism in most parameters of the nasal region. All the linear
	measurements were larger in men than in women, whereas all the angular
	measurements were smaller in men than in women. The significant differences
	in partial parameters between men and women have been proved. Ten
	of 12 linear measurements, 1 of 3 angular measurements, and 3 of
	8 nasal proportion indices showed significant sexual dimorphism (P
	< 0.01). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, the nasal anthropometric
	measurements and proportion indices of Han Chinese adults were different,
	to some extent. This study could provide credible and objective reference
	material for plastic and maxillofacial surgeons for the external
	nasal soft tissue evaluation and planning of the cosmetic nasal surgery.
	Besides, these results could be a useful guidance for preoperative
	and postoperative evaluations of secondary rhinoplasty in nasal deformity
	associated with cleft lip and palate.},

	serve as an accessible and informative index of brain dysmorphogenesis
	in neurological and psychiatric disorders of early developmental
	origin. There are three principal challenges in seeking to increase
	understanding of disorders of early brain dysmorphogenesis through
	craniofacial dysmorphogenesis: (i) the first, technical, challenge
	has been to digitize the facial surface in its inherent three-dimensionality;
	(ii) the second, analytical, challenge has been to develop methodologies
	for extracting biologically meaningful shape covariance from digitized
	samples, making statistical comparisons between groups and visualizing
	in 3D the resultant statistical models on a 'whole face' basis; (iii)
	the third, biological, challenge is to demonstrate a relationship
	between facial morphogenesis and brain morphogenesis not only in
	anatomical2013embryological terms but also at the level of brain
	function. Here we consider each of these challenges in turn and then
	illustrate the issues by way of our own findings. These use human
	sexual dimorphism as an exemplar for 3D laser surface scanning of
	facial shape, analysis using geometric morphometrics and exploration
	of cognitive correlates of variation in shape of the 'whole face',
	in the context of studies relating to the early developmental origins

	In this study of four modern human groups (Eskimo/Inuit, African,

	Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla gorilla and from 2 modern
	human populations (Zulu and Europeans from Spitalfields) were reliably
	sexed. Thirteen measurements were defined and included mandibular
	height, length and breadth in representative positions. Univariate
	statistical techniques and multivariate (principal component analysis
	and discriminant analysis) statistical techniques were used to investigate
	interspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in human and great
	ape mandibles, and intraspecific variability among the modern human
	mandibles. Analysis of interspecific differences revealed some pairs
	of variables with a tight linear relationship and others where Homo
	and the great apes pulled apart from one another due to shape differences.
	Homo and Pan are least sexually dimorphic in the mandible, Pan less
	so than Homo sapiens, but both the magnitude of sexual dimorphism
	and the distribution of sexually dimorphic measurements varied both
	among and between modern humans and great apes. Intraspecific variation
	among the 10 populations of modern humans was less than that generally
	reported in studies of crania (74.3% of mandibles were correctly
	classified into 1 of 10 populations using discriminant functions
	based on 13 variables as compared with 93% of crania from 17 populations
	based on 70 variables in one extensive study of crania). A subrecent
	European population (Poundbury) emerged as more different from a
	recent European population (Spitalfields) than other more diverse
	modern populations were from each other, suggesting considerable
	morphological plasticity in the mandible through time. This study
	forms a sound basis on which to explore mandibular variation in Neanderthals,
	early Homo sapiens and other more ancient fossil hominids.},

	the collection died during 1920 to 1940 in hospitals to where they
	came from many regions of the country, especially from unprivileged
	sociocultural milieu. The mean age is 35.57 years for males and 33.20
	for females (statistically not significant). A total of seven mandibular
	dimensions are taken according to the Martin procedure by the senior
	author. Data are analyzed initially through direct method of discriminant
	analysis statistic (SPSS). This has provided 86.7% accuracy. When
	the same dimensions are analyzed with the stepwise procedure, five
	of them (height of ascending ramus, bigonial breadth, mandibular
	length, mandibular symphysis height, minimum breadth of ascending
	ramus) are selected. Classification accuracy has remained the same
	(86.7%). This suggests that sexual dimorphism is also well pronounced

	The sample is composed of 53 white males and 53 white females and
	45 black males and 45 black females. Using 13 standard cranial and
	4 mandibular dimensions, average accuracies of 98% were obtained
	from the crania, which were much more discriminatory than the mandibles
	(74% males, 87% females). When a "leave-one-out classification" technique
	was applied to the sample to measure accuracy of multivariate classification,
	this accuracy was about the same as obtained from the multivariate
	function. A posterior probability of 0.80 or more was found in as
	much as 96% of the sample, Stepwise discriminant function formulae
	for incomplete remains (vault and face) were also derived. Prediction
	accuracy was considerably lower when North American based formulae

  abstract = {Abstract The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique serves
	as a practical tool in diagnosis, surgical planning, and outcome
	prediction of plastic and reconstructive surgery. In our study, the
	morphologic features of the Chinese adult orbit were described by
	11 anatomic parameters using a 3D reconstruction technique. Sixty-four
	Chinese adults were selected randomly from patients who had undergone
	craniofacial computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose conditions
	other than craniofacial or orbital deformations. The morphologic
	parameters of orbit such as bony orbital volume, orbital foramen
	area and orbital rim perimeter were measured on 3D models using this
	technique. Differences between the two orbits and between the two
	sexes were investigated. The method of measurement showed high reproducibility
	of results. No difference between the two orbits was found. There
	were significant differences between men and women in all anatomic
	parameters other than orbital height. In men and women, respectively,
	mean bony orbital volume was 26.02 and 23.32 mL, mean orbital foramen
	area 11.80 and 11.10 cm2, mean orbital rim perimeter 12.65 and 12.20 cm,
	mean orbital height 33.35 and 33.22 mm, mean orbital width 40.02
	and 38.00 mm; mean orbital floor length 47.93 and 46.18 mm, mean
	orbital roof length 52.93 and 50.89 mm, mean medial orbital wall
	length 46.43 and 44.41 mm, mean lateral orbital wall length 48.38
	and 46.91 mm, mean intraorbital distance 27.18 and 25.11 mm, mean
	extra-orbital distance 98.77 and 93.69 mm. It is concluded that the
	measurements of these orbital parameters could be obtained from a
	3D reconstruction method. The two orbits were symmetric based on
	orbital volume and other anatomic parameters. Orbital size was significantly
	smaller in women than in men; orbital height, however, was similar.
	The findings of the present study allow for quantification of the
	orbital features of Chinese adults and provide parameters for preoperative
	planning and prediction of postoperative outcome.},

  abstract = {Abstract: One of the four pillars of the anthropological protocol
	is the estimation of sex. The protocol generally consists of linear
	metric analysis or visually assessing individual skeletal traits
	on the skull and pelvis based on an ordinal scale of 120135, ranging
	from very masculine to very feminine. The morphologic traits are
	then some how averaged by the investigator to estimate sex. Some
	skulls may be misclassified because of apparent morphologic features
	that appear more or less robust due to size differences among individuals.
	The question of misclassification may be further exemplified in light
	of comparisons across populations that may differ not only in cranial
	robusticity but also in stature and general physique. The purpose
	of this study is to further examine the effect of size and sex on
	craniofacial shape among American populations to better understand
	the allometric foundation of skeletal traits currently used for sex
	estimation. Three-dimensional coordinates of 16 standard craniofacial
	landmarks were collected using a Microscribe-3DX digitizer. Data
	were collected for 118 American White and Black males and females
	from the W.M. Bass Donated Collection and the Forensic Data Bank.
	The MANCOVA procedure tested shape differences as a function of sex
	and size. Sex had a significant influence on shape for both American
	Whites (F = 2.90; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.0024) and Blacks (F = 2.81;
	d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.0035), whereas size did not have a significant
	influence on shape in either Whites (F = 1.69; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.08)
	or Blacks (F = 1.09; d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.40). Therefore,
	for each sex, individuals of various sizes were statistically the
	same shape. In other words, while significant differences were present
	between the size of males and females (males on average were larger),
	there was no size effect beyond that accounted for by sex differences
	in size. Moreover, the consistency between American groups is interesting
	as it suggests that population differences in sexual dimorphism may
	result more from human variation in size than allometric variation
	in craniofacial morphology.},

  abstract = {Morphometric studies often consider parts with internal left-right
	symmetry, for instance, the vertebrate skull. This type of symmetry
	is called object symmetry and is distinguished from matching symmetry,
	in which two separate structures exist as mirror images of each other,
	one on each body side. We explain a method for partitioning the total
	shape variation of landmark configurations with object symmetry into
	components of symmetric variation among individuals and asymmetry.
	This method is based on the Procrustes superimposition of the original
	and a reflected copy of each landmark configuration and is compatible
	with the two-factor ANOVA model customary in studies of fluctuating
	asymmetry. We show a fully multivariate framework for testing the
	effects in the two-factor model with MANOVA statistics, which also
	applies to shapes with matching symmetry. We apply the new methods
	in a small case study of pharyngeal jaws of the Neotropical cichlid
	fish Amphilophus citrinellus. The analysis revealed that the symmetric
	component of variation in the pharyngeal jaws is dominated by the
	contrast between two alternative trophic morphs in this species and
	that there is subtle but statistically significant directional asymmetry.
	Finally, we provide some general recommendations for morphometric
	studies of symmetric shapes.},

  abstract = {Although fluctuating asymmetry has become popular as a measure of
	developmental instability, few studies have examined its developmental
	basis. We propose an approach to investigate the role of development
	for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our
	approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA
	customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and
	can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the
	patterns of covariance among landmarks. This approach extends the
	notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections
	of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric
	concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks.
	We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings
	of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed
	significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well
	as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring
	of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly
	in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark
	covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally
	similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability)
	and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence
	that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry.
	We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to
	be involved in the development of fly wings.},

  abstract = {Forensic anthropology typically uses osteological and/or dental data
	either to estimate characteristics of unidentified individuals or
	to serve as evidence in cases where there is a putative identification.
	In the estimation context, the problem is to describe aspects of
	an individual that may lead to their eventual identification, whereas
	in the evidentiary context, the problem is to provide the relative
	support for the identification. In either context, individual characteristics
	such as sex and race may be useful. Using a previously published
	forensic case (Steadman et al. (2006) Am J Phys Anthropol 131:15-26)
	and a large (N = 3,167) reference sample, we show that the sex of
	the individual can be reliably estimated using a small set of 11
	craniometric variables. The likelihood ratio from sex (assuming a
	1:1 sex ratio for the ldquopopulation at largerdquo) is, however,
	relatively uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification.
	Similarly, the known ldquoracerdquo of the individual is relatively
	uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification, because the
	individual was recovered from an area where the 2000 US census provides
	a very homogenous picture of (self-identified) race. Of interest
	in this analysis is the fact that the individual, who was recovered
	from Eastern Iowa, classifies very clearly with [Howells 1973. Cranial
	Variation in Man: A Study by Multivariate Analysis of Patterns of
	Difference Among Recent Human Populations. Cambridge, MA: Peabody

	with uninformative priors. When the Iowa 2000 Census data on self-reported

  abstract = {Abstract Normal and abnormal jaw growth and tooth eruption are topics
	of great importance for several dental and medical disciplines. Thus
	far, clinical studies on these topics have used two-dimensional (2D)
	radiographic techniques. The purpose of the present study was to
	analyse normal mandibular growth and tooth eruption in three dimensions
	based on computer tomography (CT) scans, extending the principles
	of mandibular growth analysis proposed by Björk in 1969 from two
	to three dimensions. As longitudinal CT data from normal children
	are not available (for ethical reasons), CT data from children with
	Apert syndrome were employed, because it has been shown that the
	mandible in Apert syndrome is unaffected by the malformation, and
	these children often have several craniofacial CT scans performed
	during childhood for planning of cranial and midface surgery and
	for follow-up after surgery. A total of 49 datasets from ten children
	with Apert syndrome were available for study. The number of datasets
	from each individual ranged from three to seven. The first CT scan
	in each of the ten series was carried out before 1 year of age, and
	the ages for the 49 scans ranged from 1 week to 14.5 years. The mandible
	and the teeth were segmented and iso-surfaces generated. Landmarks
	were placed on the surface of the mandible, along the mandibular
	canals, the inner contour of the cortical plate at the lower border
	of the symphysis menti, and on the teeth. Superimposition of the
	mandibles in the longitudinal series was performed using the symphysis
	menti and the mandibular canals as suggested by Björk. The study
	supported the findings of stability of the symphysis menti and the
	mandibular canals as seen in profile view previously reported by
	Björk & Skieller in 1983. However, the mandibular canals were, actually,
	relocated laterally during growth. Furthermore, the position of tooth
	buds remained relatively stable inside the jaw until root formation
	started. Eruption paths of canines and premolars were vertical, whereas
	molars erupted in a lingual direction. The 3D method would seem to
	offer new insight into jaw growth and tooth eruption, but further
	studies are needed.},

	morphology, gender and facial profile? Material and Methods: &nbsp;&nbsp;Profile
	photos of 110 adult patients were measured according to A.M. Schwarz
	landmarks using Onyx Ceph. Centroid size was calculated from x and
	y-coordinates. After Procrustes transformation, a principal component
	analysis for identifying major components of facial morphology was
	performed and the results visualized using thin-plate splines. At
	the same time, lateral cephalograms of all patients were analyzed
	according to Hasund. Results: &nbsp;&nbsp;There were significant
	differences in centroid size betweeen male and female patients. Only
	the vertical skeletal structure had an impact on centroid size. Six
	components (PC1 to PC6) were identified using PCA. They were responsible
	for 86.5% of the variance. PC1 (33.9%) described scaling along an
	axis from Porion to chin. PC2 (28.6%) characterized the vertical
	dimensions of the lower face. Significant differences were only apparent
	between males and females in PC3 and PC4. In terms of cephalometric
	parameters, PC2 and PC3 differed in the vertical, and PC1 und PC2
	in the sagittal configuration. Conclusions: &nbsp;&nbsp;The analyses
	presented here suffice for describing facial morphology qualitatively
	and quantitatively as demonstrated by this example. Separating size
	from shape is useful for investigating therapeutically and growth-related
	morphological changes. It is difficult to draw conclusions about
	skeletal parameters.}

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to construct a mesh-model of a newborn
	skull for finite element analysis to study its deformation when subjected
	to the forces present during labour. The current state of medical
	imaging technology has reached a level which allows accurate visualisation
	and shape recovery of biological organs and body-parts. However,
	a sufficiently large set of medical images cannot always be obtained,
	often because of practical or ethical reasons, and the requirement
	to recover the shape of the biological object of interest has to
	be met by other means. Such is the case for a newborn skull. A method
	to recover the three-dimensional (3D) shape from (minimum) two orthogonal
	atlas images of the object of interest and a homologous object is
	described. This method is based on matching landmarks and curves
	on the orthogonal images of the object of interest with corresponding
	landmarks and curves on the homologous or 'master'-object which is
	fully defined in 3D space. On the basis of this set of corresponding
	landmarks, a thin-plate spline function can be derived to warp from
	the 'master'-object space to the 'slave'-object space. This method
	is applied to recover the 3D shape of a newborn skull. Images from
	orthogonal view-planes are obtained from an atlas. The homologous
	object is an adult skull, obtained from CT-images made available
	by the Visible Human Project. After shape recovery, a mesh-model
	of the newborn skull is generated.},

  abstract = {Die Schnittbildverfahren CT und insbesondere MRT sind aus der modernen
	Orbitadiagnostik nicht mehr wegzudenken. Insbesondere der Einsatz
	von Oberflächenspulen hat die MRT zur Methode der Wahl bei nahezu
	allen Fragestellungen im Bereich der Orbita gemacht. Bei der Wertung
	der MRT für die Orbitadiagnostik sind zwei Bereiche zu trennen, nämlich
	differentialdiagnostische Überlegungen und das Tumorstaging.   Patienten
	mit Veränderungen im Bereich der Orbita, die von einem Ophthalmologen
	zur MRT überwiesen werden, haben häufig schon eine sonographische
	oder computertomographische Diagnostik durchlaufen, sodass die MRT
	zur Differentialdiagnose nur noch wenig beitragen muss. Durch die
	Möglichkeit der MRT, Schnittbilder in allen Raumebenen anzufertigen,
	ist die Zuordnung von orbitalen Prozessen zu einem Orbitakompartiment
	und damit die differentialdiagnostische Einordnung erheblich leichter
	und genauer als bei der transversalen CT. So ist z. B. die Zuordnung
	eines vergrößerten M. rectus inferior im transversalen CT-Bild erheblich
	schwerer als im koronaren MRT-Bild. Die MRT ist gegenüber der CT
	darüber hinaus im Vorteil, weil durch den höheren Weichteilkontrast
	Gewebeinformationen verfügbar sind, die eine Differenzierung verschiedener
	Pathologien erlaubt. Lediglich beim Nachweis von Kalk ist die CT
	der MRT überlegen, was beispielsweise bei Veränderungen des Sehnervs
	(Optikusscheidenmeningeom) wegweisend sein kann. Besonders hervorzuheben
	für die Bedeutung der MRT ist die Diagnostik der endokrinen Orbitopathie:
	Hier ist die MRT in der Lage, durch Messung bzw. Berechnung quantitativer
	Parameter eine Aussage über den Akuitätsgrad der Erkrankung abzugeben,
	was direkte Auswirkungen auf das therapeutische Procedere hat. Auf
	der anderen Seite ist bei einem bekannten Tumor das Tumorstaging
	vor Beginn einer Therapie von entscheidender Bedeutung, so z. B.
	bei präseptalen Tumoren, Bulbustumoren, aber auch sämtlichen retrobulbären
	Tumoren. Die MRT ermöglicht hier eine Weichteildifferenzierung, wie
	sie mit der CT nicht und mit der Sonographie nur zum Teil erreicht
	wird. Erst im Bereich der Orbitaspitze und bei knöchernen Veränderungen
	ist die CT der MRT meist überlegen.},

	CT in the maxillofacial region.Study design Electronic databases
	were searched with the help of a senior health sciences librarian.
	Abstracts that appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria
	were selected by consensus. The original articles were then retrieved
	and their references hand-searched for possible missing articles.Results
	A total of 8 articles met the selection criteria. Differences between
	the magnitudes of errors of landmarks and their associated measurements
	were discussed.Conclusions It was concluded that each landmark exhibited
	a characteristic pattern of error that contributed to measurement
	inaccuracy, and with repeated practice of landmark identifications,
	the error can be reduced to within 0.5 mm for 2-D CT. Considerations
	have to be given to some of the 3-D CT reliability values because
	they can have diagnosis implications.}

	This investigation is conducted using 3D Fisherfaces and demonstrates
	that region ensembles improve the ability of the Fisherface approach
	to create discriminating features, even for untrained subject samples.
	In fact, comparable performance can be achieved using significantly
	fewer training subjects. In addition, gallery score normalization
	is integrated into the region ensemble framework and is shown to
	improve performance over a single normalization of the ensemble match
	score. Performance improvement is particularly evident at low false
	alarm rates. An All versus All comparison of the FRGC 2.0 database
	obtains a 97.1% True Accept Rate (TAR) at 0.1% False Accept Rate
	(FAR) when the approach is trained with 100 subjects and improves
	to 98.1% with integrated gallery score normalization.},

	shapes of the outer mandible contour of Caucasian and Chinese people,
	offering data for the production of preformed mandible reconstruction
	plates.Methods A CT-database of 925 Caucasians (male: n=463, female:
	n=462) and 960 Chinese (male: n=469, female: n=491) including scans
	of unaffected mandibles were used and imported into the 3D modeling
	software Voxim (IVS-Solutions, Chemnitz, Germany). Anatomical landmarks
	(n=22 points for both sides) were set using the 3D view along the
	outer contour of the mandible at the area where reconstruction plates
	are commonly located. We used morphometric methods for statistical
	shape analysis.Results We found statistical relevant differences
	between populations including a distinct discrimination given by
	the landmarks at the mandible. After generating a metric model this
	shape information which separated the populations appeared to be
	of no clinical relevance. The metric size information given by ramus
	length however provided a profound base for the production of standard
	reconstruction plates.Conclusion Clustering by ramus length into
	three sizes and calculating means of these size-clusters seem to
	be a good solution for constructing preformed reconstruction plates
	that will fit a vast majority.},

	we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus,
	Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96
	traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the
	face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania
	for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories
	are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative
	warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens
	are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape
	space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different
	from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among
	themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic
	differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce
	the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony
	does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor
	the differences among the African apes.},

  abstract = {Facial reconstruction has been widely criticised for its subjective
	nature and is thus often viewed as a last resort. Recent computer-aided
	reconstructions, which claim to be objective, may be subject to similar
	errors. To date, both manual reconstructions and computer-aided techniques
	have been limited to using the same tissue depth data reference tables.
	We propose that it is not solely the accuracy of the soft tissue
	depth data, but the sparsity of landmarks, which contributes to a
	lack of understanding of how soft tissue changes between the landmarks.
	The authors feel that a new approach to facial reconstruction using
	a computer graphics technique known as volume deformation addresses
	some of the problems encountered in the past. A review of previous
	methods is provided with discussion of the strengths and limitations
	of these techniques. In addition, areas are highlighted where the
	new deformation-based approach may offer possible solutions.},

  abstract = {Human mandibular morphology is often thought to reflect mainly function,
	and to be of lesser value in studies of population history. Previous
	descriptions of human mandibles showed variation in ramal height
	and breadth to be the strongest difference among recent human groups.
	Several mandibular traits that differentiate Neanderthals from modern
	humans include greater robusticity, a receding symphysis, a large
	retromolar space, a rounder gonial area, an asymmetric mandibular
	notch, and a posteriorly positioned mental foramen in Neanderthals.
	Nevertheless, the degree to which these differences are part of modern
	human variation and/or are related to size and function remains unclear.
	The aim of this study was to document geographic and functional patterning
	in the mandibular shape of recent humans, to assess the effects of
	allometry on mandibular form, and to quantitatively evaluate proposed
	"Neanderthal" mandibular traits through comparison with samples of
	geographically diverse recent humans. Data were collected in the
	form of three-dimensional coordinates of 28 landmarks. Unlike previous
	studies, this analysis found that modern human mandibular shape exhibits
	considerable geographic patterning, with some aspects of mandibular
	morphology reflecting a climatic gradient, and others, a functional
	specialization. Population history is also reflected in mandibular
	form, albeit relatively weakly. Proposed "Neanderthal" traits were
	found to separate Neanderthal from modern human mandibles successfully
	in the statistical analysis. Of these, the retromolar gap was found
	to be related to increased mandibular size in modern humans. The
	status of this trait as a Neanderthal autapomorphy should therefore
	be treated with caution.},

	race concept from classic physical anthropology and applied it to
	methods of human identification. Why and how the biological race
	concept might work in forensic anthropology was contemplated by Sauer
	(Soc Sci Med 34 107-111), who hypothesized that American forensic
	anthropologists are good at what they do because of a concordance
	between social race and skeletal morphology in American whites and
	blacks. However, Sauer also stressed that this concordance did not
	validate the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology
	that there are a relatively small number of discrete types of human
	beings. Results from Howells (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 67 1-259; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 79 1-189; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 82 1-108) and others using craniometric and molecular
	data show strong geographic patterning of human variation despite
	overlap in their distributions. However, Williams et al. (Curr Anthropol
	46 340-346) concluded that skeletal morphology cannot be used to
	accurately classify individuals. Williams et al. cited additional
	support from Lewontin (Evol Biol 6 381-398), who analyzed classic
	genetic markers. In this study, multivariate analyses of craniometric
	data support Sauer's hypothesis that there are morphological differences
	between American whites and blacks. We also confirm significant geographic
	patterning in human variation but also find differences among groups
	within continents. As a result, if biological races are defined by
	uniqueness, then there are a very large number of biological races
	that can be defined, contradicting the classic biological race concept
	of physical anthropology. Further, our results show that humans can
	be accurately classified into geographic origin using craniometrics
	even though there is overlap among groups. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, geometric morphometric methods have been applied
	increasingly to the study of human form. When too few landmarks are
	available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points.
	The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so
	as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous
	from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not.
	This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy
	(BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference
	form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes
	necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained.
	We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement,
	principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human
	molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the
	two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar
	for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both
	criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample
	variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes
	obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification
	is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant
	scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can
	alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small,
	as in the analysis of modern human populations.},

  abstract = {Background: The clinical observation has been made that the shape
	of the mandible changes with age in certain individuals. Because
	the shape and size of the mandible are so important to the human
	perception of youth, this observation was subjected to a pilot study.
	Methods: Longitudinal data available at the Bolton Brush Growth Study
	were evaluated. Only dentate individuals were included in the study.
	Serial frontal radiographs were analyzed from the same individual
	taken during youth and maturity for 16 individuals, eight female
	subjects and eight male subjects (n = 16). The mean age for youth
	was 16.2 years for female and male subjects. The mean age at maturity
	was 56.1 years for female subjects and 56.4 years for male subjects.
	Tracings were made of the mandibular border for each individual,
	at youth and at maturity. The only reliable way to analyze shape
	is the modern technique of geometric morphometric analysis, which
	was therefore used in this study. Other techniques, such as angular
	values and two-dimensional linear measurements, were dismissed because
	they have been shown to be unreliable for evaluating shape. Results:
	There was a statistically significant difference in shape for both
	male subjects and female subjects that occurred with age (p = 0.02
	for female subjects and p = 0.001 for male subjects). The mandible
	continued to grow: the shape changed because some areas continued
	to grow faster than other areas. This is in accordance with the principle
	of differential growth of the facial skeleton. Conclusions: It is
	important for the cosmetic surgeon to evaluate the lower face before
	surgery and to understand that both bone and soft tissue can play
	a role in the appearance of the lower face in older individuals.
	A small lower face is highly attractive and conveys the impression
	of youth, and any soft-tissue procedure that can create the illusion
	of a diminutive lower face will improve the cosmetic result of the
	face lift procedure.},

	evolution and skeletal biology. Sexual dimorphic characteristics
	can be studied morphologically and metrically, although morphologic
	studies pose several problems such as difficulties with quantification
	and interobserver error. Geometric morphometrics is a relatively
	new method that allows better assessment of morphologic characteristics.
	This paper aims to investigate the usability of this method by assessing
	three different morphologic characteristics in a sample of South
	African blacks: shape of the greater sciatic notch, mandibular ramus
	flexure, and shape of the orbits. Relative warps, thin-plate splines,
	and canonical variates analysis (CVA) analyses were performed. As
	expected, the shape of the greater sciatic notch provided the best
	separation between the sexes. Surprisingly, however, the shape of
	the orbits performed better that ramus flexure. Several possible
	explanations for this result are possible, which include the possibility
	that orbit shape is more sexually dimorphic than previously expected,
	or that biological reality is not reflected by this technique. More
	research is, however, needed.},

  abstract = {Two facial models corresponding to two deceased subjects have been
	manually created and the two corresponding skulls have been dissected
	and skeletonized. These pairs of skull/ facial data have been scanned
	with a CT scanner, and the computed geometric three-dimensional models
	of both skulls and facial tissue have been built. One set of skull/facial
	data will be used as a reference set whereas the second set is used
	as ground truth for validating our method. After a semi-automatic
	face-skull registration, we apply an original computing global parametric
	transformation T that turns the reference skull into the skull to
	be reconstructed. This algorithm is based upon salient lines of the
	skull called crest lines: more precisely the crest lines of the first
	skull are matched to the crest lines of the second skull by an iterative
	closest point algorithm. Then we apply this algorithm to the reference
	face to obtain the "unknown" face to be reconstructed. The reliability
	and difficulties of this original technique are then discussed.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic traits have been used for centuries for the purpose of
	racial classification. Developments in quantitative population genetics
	have allowed global comparison of patterns of phenotypic variation
	with patterns of variation in classical genetic markers and DNA markers.
	Human skin color shows a high degree of variation among geographic
	regions, typical of traits that show extensive natural selection.
	Even given this high level of geographic differentiation, skin color
	variation is clinal and is not well described by discrete racial
	categories. Craniometric traits show a level of among-region differentiation
	comparable to genetic markers, with high levels of variation within
	populations as well as a correlation between phenotypic and geographic
	distance. Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing
	high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from
	different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global
	variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race
	concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them
	are arbitrary. The race concept is at best a crude first-order approximation
	to the geographically structured phenotypic variation in the human
	species. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

  abstract = {Previous studies of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA have found
	that the amount of variation among major geographic groupings of
	Homo sapiens is relatively low, accounting for roughly 10% of total
	variation. This conclusion has had implications for the study of
	human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin
	of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the
	level of among-group variation for morphological traits is much higher.
	This study examines the level of among-group variation based on craniometric
	data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by
	W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics
	theory was used to provide an estimate of FST--a measure of among-group
	variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic
	markers. Data for 57 craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were
	analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub-Saharan
	Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An
	additional set of analyses was performed using a three-region subset
	(Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability
	with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete
	heritability) for the three-region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum
	FST for the six-region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less
	than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10-0.11).
	The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since
	it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability.
	Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature
	provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three-region analysis
	and 0.144 for the six-region analysis. These results show that genetic
	and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively,
	and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major
	geographic regions.},

	are retained both approaches represent orthogonal rotations of the

	analyses based on distances) must be the same for both analyses.
	When true shapes are known to be smooth, dropping higher-order Fourier
	harmonics results in a desirable smoothing of the digitized outline
	and a large reduction in computational cost.An alternative method
	of eigenshape analysis is presented and related to elliptical Fourier

	craniofacial complex was analyzed using geometric morphometric methods.
	Thin-plate splines (TPS) analysis has been applied to investigate
	the lateral profile of complete adult skulls of known sex. Twenty-nine
	three-dimensional (3D) craniofacial and mandibular landmark coordinates
	were recorded from a sample of 52 adult females and 52 adult males
	of known age and sex. No difference in the influence of size on shape
	was detected between sexes. Both size and sex had significant influences
	on shape. As expected, the influence of centroid size on shape (allometry)
	revealed a shift in the proportions of the neurocranium and the viscerocranium,
	with a marked allometric variation of the lower face. Adjusted for
	centroid size, males presented a relatively larger size of the nasopharyngeal
	space than females. A mean-male TPS transformation revealed a larger
	piriform aperture, achieved by an increase of the angulation of the
	nasal bones and a downward rotation of the anterior nasal floor.
	Male pharynx expansion was also reflected by larger choanae and a
	more posteriorly inclined basilar part of the occipital clivus. Male
	muscle attachment sites appeared more pronounced. In contrast, the
	mean-female TPS transformation was characterized by a relatively
	small nasal aperture. The occipital clivus inclined anteriorly, and
	muscle insertion areas became smoothed. Besides these variations,
	both maxillary and mandibular alveolar regions became prognathic.
	The sex-specific TPS deformation patterns are hypothesized to be
	associated with sexual differences in body composition and energetic
	requirements.},

  abstract = {In both diagnostic fields a two-stage strategy is recommended: to
	first use "field" methods that are quick and easy but more imprecise
	and then "laboratory" methods that are time consuming but more precise.
	In preparing skeletal work, individuality of a skeleton should be
	checked, traces of diseases sought and time since death assessed.
	For sexing non-adults, the field methods are tooth mineralisation,
	long bone length and a few morphological skull and pelvis characteristics,
	for adults it is the morphology of pelvis and skull, and for both
	age groups the advanced laboratory method is molecular biology. For
	ageing non-adults the methods are mineralisation of teeth, long bone
	length and epiphysis development. For ageing adults the advanced
	laboratory method is aspartic acid racemisation. Less accurate laboratory
	methods are cement ring counts and histology of bones and teeth.
	Quick morphological methods using the pubic symphysis and other traits
	in combinations follow. Finally, cranial sutures and tooth number
	give a quick and rough impression. For the selection of a method
	and the assessment of its value the stochastic error produced for
	the reference sample is the decisive criterion; it should also be
	used to assess the reliability of a single diagnosis. Prerequisites
	for all work with skeletons are not only a complete knowledge of
	the relevant biology as well as specific techniques but also initial
	detailed instructions and with forensic applications, personal experience.}

  abstract = {Summary An original procedure based on new developments in elliptical
	Fourier methods associated with image analysis technics was applied
	to 117 human mandibles in lateral view (69 males, 48 females) in
	order to analyze interindividual variability and sexual dimorphism.
	Original parameters, called elliptical Fourier descriptors, allowed
	for the quantification of the shape of an outline irrespective of
	its morphological complexity, and provided a precise individual characterization.
	The use of step by step reconstructions with an increasing number
	of harmonics allowed for demonstration of the morphological contributions
	of the elliptical Fourier descriptors, and relationships to precise
	anatomical features were established. The first harmonics (1st to
	8th) described the general mandibular shape, and the later harmonics
	(8th to 14th) characterized accessory and finer morphological features.
	The proportion of individuals presenting significant sexual dimorphism
	was 97.1% in males and 91.7% in females, and after size normalization
	84.1% in males and 81.2% in females. Even after removal of the size
	component, these results in regard to mandibular dimorphism remained
	better than those found by classical approaches; this could be due
	to the use of elliptical Fourier analysis which takes into account
	all the information of the mandibular outline. Compared to the size
	component, the shape component seemed to be more important in the
	sexual dimorphism of the human mandible than previously recognized.
	The present approach opens interesting anthropological and clinical
	perspectives for the characterization of mandibular morphology.},

  abstract = {The average thickness of soft tissues on parts of the face is known,
	but its variation has not been related to cranial morphology. To
	investigate this relationship, measurements of facial soft-tissue
	depths and craniometric dimensions were taken on adult, white Australian
	cadavers (17 male and 23 female). Significant correlations between
	many soft-tissue depths and craniometric dimensions were found, suggesting
	a relationship between the amount of soft tissue present on the face
	and the size of the underlying bony skeleton. Soft-tissue depths
	were highly positively correlated with each other; craniometric dimensions
	were correlated but to a lesser extent. Males had thicker soft tissues
	and larger craniometric dimensions than females; considerable overlap
	of ranges was also noted. Multiple regression analysis was used to
	produce equations predicting the soft-tissue depth at specified areas
	of the face from craniometric dimensions. A subsample of nine cadavers
	was examined for the effects of tissue embalming. Embalming caused
	significant initial increases in facial soft-tissue depths. Cadavers
	embalmed for less than 6 months had soft-tissue depths significantly
	greater than for fully embalmed cadavers. The evidence that facial
	soft-tissue thicknesses vary with craniofacial dimensions has implications
	for forensic identification, facial aesthetic surgery, and approximation
	of the facial features of extinct individuals. Am J Phys Anthropol

	there is a clear need to secure identifications in an objective way
	based on anthropometric measures. Anthropometry has existed for many
	years and has evolved with each advent of new technology and computing
	power. As a result of this, face recognition methodology has shifted
	from a purely 2D image-based approach to the use of 3D facial shape.
	However, one of the main challenges still remaining is the non-rigid
	structure of the face, which can change permanently over varying
	time-scales and briefly with facial expressions. The majority of
	face recognition methods have been developed by scientists with a
	very technical background such as biometry, pattern recognition and
	computer vision. This article strives to bridge the gap between these
	communities and the forensic science end-users. A concise review
	of face recognition using 3D shape is given. Methods using 3D shape
	applied to data embodying facial expressions are tabulated for reference.
	From this list a categorization of different strategies to deal with
	expressions is presented. The underlying concepts and practical issues
	relating to the application of each strategy are given, without going
	into technical details. The discussion clearly articulates the justification
	to establish archival, reference databases to compare and evaluate
	different strategies.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the degree to which various subsets of morphological
	data reflect molecular relationships is crucial for studies attempting
	to estimate genetic relationships from patterns of morphological
	variation. This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different
	human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional
	landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls
	from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided
	into anatomical regions: basicranium, tipper face, mandible, temporal
	bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around
	the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances
	were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same
	or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological
	variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular
	distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium,
	temporal bone, upper race, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest
	correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible,
	upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly
	correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology
	of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium
	appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially
	with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable
	to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic
	relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. Am. J. Hum.

  abstract = {Abstract: The success of facial approximation is thought to depend,
	at least in part, upon the "accuracy" of the constructed face. However,
	methods of accuracy assessment are varied and this range in methods
	may be responsible for the disparate results reported in the literature.
	The aim of this study was to determine if the accuracy results of
	one facial approximation were comparable across two different assessment
	methods (resemblance ratings and simultaneous face array tests using
	unfamiliar assessors) and if resemblance ratings co-varied with recognition
	responses. True-positive recognition performance from the facial
	approximation was poor (21%) while resemblance scores using the same
	facial approximation were moderately high (3 out of 5 on a five-point
	scale). These results are not, therefore, consistent and indicate
	that either different variables are being evaluated by the methods,
	or the same variable is being examined but with different weight/calibration.
	Further resemblance ratings tests of the facial approximation to
	three foil faces from the face array revealed that resemblance scores
	were similar irrespective of which face was compared, and did not
	closely correspond with the degree of recognition performance. This
	was especially the case for isolated comparisons of single faces
	to the facial approximation. Collectively, these results indicate
	that resemblance ratings are: (i) insensitive measures of a facial
	approximation's accuracy; and (ii) inconsistent with results of unfamiliar
	simultaneous face-array recognition results. These data suggest that
	familiar and unfamiliar recognition tests should be given increased
	weight in contrast to current resemblance rating tests.},

	One entrenched notion is male facial features that are affected by
	testosterone are used as direct cues in mate preference. Testosterone
	may be particularly revealing as it is purported to be an honest
	indicator of male fitness. Increased testosterone may impose an immunocompetence
	handicap on the bearer and only the best males can carry this handicap.
	To date, tests of this theory have been indirect, and have relied
	on digital manipulations that represent unrealistic continuums of
	masculine and feminine faces. We provide a much more direct test
	by manipulating digitally male faces to mimic known shape variation,
	caused by varying levels of testosterone through puberty. We produced
	a continuum of faces that ranged from low to high levels of testosterone
	in male faces and asked women to choose the points on the continuum
	that appeared most attractive and most physically dominant. Our data
	indicate that high testosterone faces reveal dominance. However,
	there is no evidence of directional selection for increased (or decreased)
	testosterone in terms of attractiveness to the opposite sex. We discuss
	the relevance and applicability of evolutionary interpretations of
	our data and, contrary to predictions, provide evidence of stabilizing
	selection acting on testosterone through mate preferences.},

  abstract = {Abstract The chin, or mentum osseum, is one of the most distinctive
	anatomical traits of modern humans. A variety of hypotheses for the
	adaptive value of the chin have been proposed, ranging from mechanical
	stress resistance to sexual selection via mate choice. While the
	sexual selection hypothesis predicts dimorphism in chin shape, most
	biomechanical hypotheses preclude it. Therefore determining the presence
	or absence of significant sexual dimorphism in chin shape provides
	a useful method for differentiating between various adaptive hypotheses;
	however, this has yet to be done due to a lack of quantitative data
	on chin shape. The goals of this study are therefore: (1) to introduce
	a new method for quantifying chin shape and (2) to determine the
	presence or absence of sexual dimorphism in chin shape in a diverse
	sample of modern humans. Samples were drawn from recent human skeletal
	collections representing nine geographic regions. Outlines of mentum
	osseum contours were quantified using elliptical Fourier function
	analysis (EFFA). Fourier coefficients were analyzed using principal
	components analysis (PCA). Sexual dimorphism in chin shape was assessed
	using PC loadings in the pooled geographic sample, and statistically
	significant differences were found. These findings provide the first
	quantitative, morphologically based evidence in support of adaptive
	hypotheses that predict dimorphism in chin shape, including the sexual
	selection hypothesis. Am J Phys Anthropol 143:417-425, 2010. © 2010

	Since they consider the whole head as the object of interest, usual
	reconstruction techniques are global and involve a large number of
	parameters to be estimated. We present a local technique which aims
	at reaching a good trade-off between bias and variance following
	the paradigm of non-parametric statistics. The estimation is localized
	on patches delimited by surface geodesics between anatomical points
	of the skull. The technique relies on a continuous representation
	of the individual surfaces embedded in the vectorial space of extended
	normal vector fields. This allows to compute deformations and averages
	of surfaces. It consists in estimating the soft-tissue surface over
	patches. Using a homogeneous database described in [31], we obtain
	results on the chin and nasal regions with an average error below
	1 mm, outperforming the global reconstruction techniques.},

	a topic guaranteed to attract attention, thus drawing in scholars
	who until recently disdained interest in such basically human fossil
	hominids. They are now willing to direct their students' and even
	their own research toward late archaic humans (such as Neandertals)
	and early modern humans in whatever portion of the Old World is most

	a key component to the identification of missing persons and victims

	show how a face space can be tailored to a specific unknown, or questioned
	skull. A set of database derived estimates of the questioned face
	is constructed by first computing non-rigid transformations between
	the known head-scan skulls and the questioned skull followed by application
	of these transformations to the known head-scan faces. This effectively
	factors out influences due to skeletal variation. A tailored face
	space is formed by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
	this ensemble of estimates of the questioned face. Thus, the face
	space is a direct approximation of correlated soft tissue variance
	indicative of the population. Ours is the first mathematical representation
	of the face continuum associated with a given skull. Embedded in
	this space resides the elements needed for recognition.},

	difficult to repeat from the published literature. Primarily, this
	is because of the methods underlying qualitative basis but other
	factors contribute including: misreports in the secondary literature
	of Gerasimovs method essence; a lack of published details concerning
	Gerasimovs modeling mastic; Gerasimovs deviation from his own published
	nose projection prediction guidelines; and continued refinement of
	the methods in the 15 years following their foremost publication.
	As Gerasimov cannot be consulted to resolve these issues, we provide
	solutions via one of his five former principal students. This includes
	clarification of Gerasimovs method and use of soft tissue depths;
	the constitution of his modeling mastic; methods used for nose projection
	prediction; and refinements made to his methods following their primary

	technique. This method involves building a face with clay or other
	suitable material on to a skull or its cast, taking into account
	appropriate facial thickness measurements together with information
	provided by anthropologists such as approximate age, sex, race and
	other individual indiosyncrasies. A method for facial reconstruction
	is presented using 3-D computer graphics and is compared with the
	manual technique. The computer method involves initially digitising
	a skull using a laser scanner and video camera interfaced to a computer.
	A face, from a data bank which has previously digitised facial surfaces,
	is then placed over the skull in the form of a mask and the skin
	thickness is altered to conform with the underlying skull. The advantage
	of the computer method is its speed and flexibility. We have shown
	that the computer method for reconstructing a face is feasible and
	furthermore has the advantage over the manual technique of speed
	and flexibility. Nevertheless, the technique is far from perfect.
	Further facial thickness data needs collecting and the method requires
	evaluation using both known control skulls and later unknown remains.},

	the cross-sectional areas of the jaw muscles (measured in CT scans)
	and a number of facial angles and dimensions (measured from lateral
	radiographs). Multivariate statistical analysis of the skeletal variables
	in a group of 50 subjects led to the recognition of six independent
	factors determining facial shape, i.e, 1) cranial base length, 2)
	lower facial height, 3) cranial base flexure and prognathism, 4)
	facial width, 5) mandibular length, and 6) upper facial height. In
	29 of these subjects, the cross-sectional areas of the jaw muscles
	were determined, and correlations between these areas and the scores
	on the above-mentioned factors were calculated. It appeared that
	the cross-sectional areas of temporalis and masseter muscles correlated
	positively with facial width, whereas the areas of masseter and both
	pterygoid muscles did so with mandibular length. It has been shown
	experimentally that a decrease in jaw muscle size in various animals
	likewise has an effect on facial width and mandibular length. Our
	results therefore support the hypothesis that in man too the jaw
	muscles affect facial growth and partly determine the final facial
	dimensions. They also hint that the role of each muscle is different.}

	computed tomography (CT) data of living individuals. Three-dimensional
	models of the skulls of two white North American adults (one male,
	one female) were imported into the computer system. Facial reconstructions
	were produced by two practitioners following the Manchester method.
	Two posters were produced, each including a face pool of five surface
	model images and the facial reconstruction. The face pool related
	to the sex, age, and ethnic group of the target individual and included
	the surface model image of the target individual. Fifty-two volunteers
	were asked to choose the face from the face pool that most resembled
	each reconstruction. Both reconstructions received majority percentage
	hit rates that were at least 50% greater than any other face in the
	pool. The combined percentage hit rate was 50% above chance (70%).
	A quantitative comparison of the facial morphology between the facial
	reconstructions and the CT scan models of the subjects was carried
	out using Rapidform 2004 PP2-RF4. The majority of the surfaces of
	the facial reconstructions showed less than 2.5 mm error and 90%
	of the male face and 75% of the female face showed less than 5 mm
	error. Many of the differences between the facial reconstructions
	and the facial scans were probably the result of positional effects
	caused during the CT scanning procedure, especially on the female
	subject who had a fatter face than the male subject. The areas of
	most facial reconstruction error were at the ears and nasal tip.}

	to the data gathered using the digitizer, although this error is
	more heavily concentrated in certain types, of landmarks. All possible
	linear distances between unique pairs of landmarks were calculated,
	and like linear distances were compared between the two data collection
	methods. The absolute difference for all like linear distances ranged
	from 0.001-3.9 mm (mean = 0.377 mm SD = 1.136), with the eTDIPS data
	being consistently larger than the digitizer coordinates. This study
	demonstrates that landmark coordinate data can be reliably collected

	the curvature of the orbits, zygomatic arches, nasal aperture, and
	maxillary alveolar process were collected from a cross-sectional
	cranial sample of mixed sex and ancestry (male and female; African-
	and European-American), partitioned into three age groups (young
	adult = 1839; middle-aged = 4059 years; and elderly = 60+ years).
	Each facial region's semilandmarks were aligned into a common coordinate
	system via generalized Procrustes superimposition. Regional variation
	in shape was then explored via a battery of multivariate statistical
	techniques. Age-related shape differences were detected in the orbits,
	zygomatic arches, and maxillary alveolar process. Interactions between
	age, sex, and ancestry were also identified. Vector plots revealed
	patterns of superoinferior compression, lateral expansion, and posterior
	recession depending on the population/subpopulation, location, and
	age groups examined. These findings indicate that adult craniofacial
	curvature shape is not static throughout human life. Instead, age-related
	spatial modifications occur in various regions of the craniofacial
	skeleton. Moreover, these regional alterations vary not only through
	time, but across human populations and the sexes. Am J Phys Anthropol

	structures of the organism under investigation permits a comprehensive

	terms of differential growth. The application of this method to the
	analysis of human craniofacial shape variation reveals distinct modes
	of growth and development of the neurocranial and viscerocranial
	regions of the skull. Our data further indicate that variations in
	the orientation of the viscerocranium relative to the neurocranium
	impinge on the shapes of the face and the cranial vault.},
