  abstract = {This study presents a novel three-dimensional analysis using statistical
	atlases and automated measurements to assess diaphyseal morphology
	of the clavicle and its relationship to muscle asymmetry. A sample
	of 505 individuals (285 males, 220 females) from the William McCormick
	Clavicle Collection was CT scanned, segmented, and added to a statistical
	bone atlas that captures correspondence between homologous points
	on the bone surfaces. Muscle attachment sites were localized on the
	atlas and then propagated across the entire population. Cross-sectional
	contours were extracted at 5% increments along the entire bone, as
	well as at muscle attachment sites and the clavicle waist; maximum
	and minimum dimensions of each cross-sectional contour were calculated.
	In addition, the entire three-dimensional surface was examined for
	asymmetry by analyzing the magnitude and directional differences
	between homologous points across all bone surfaces in the dataset.
	The results confirm the existing studies on clavicle asymmetry, namely
	that the left clavicle is longer than the right, but the right is
	more robust than the left. However, the patterns of asymmetry are
	sexually dimorphic. Males are significantly asymmetric in all dimensions
	and at muscle and ligament attachment sites (P < 0.05), whereas female
	asymmetry is more variable. We hypothesize that this is related to
	absolute and relative differences in male muscle strength compared
	to females. However, an area with no muscle attachments on the posterior
	midshaft was significantly asymmetric in both sexes. We suggest that
	this is a curvature difference caused by opposing muscle actions
	at the medial and lateral ends of the bone. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012.

  abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) regression (a.k.a. projection on latent
	structures) is a recent technique that combines features from and
	generalizes principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear
	regression. Its goal is to predict a set of dependent variables from
	a set of independent variables or predictors. This prediction is
	achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors
	called latent variables which have the best predictive power. These
	latent variables can be used to create displays akin to PCA displays.
	The quality of the prediction obtained from a PLS regression model
	is evaluated with cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap
	and jackknife. There are two main variants of PLS regression: The
	most common one separates the roles of dependent and independent
	variables; the second one-used mostly to analyze brain imaging data
	gives the same roles to dependent and independent variables. Copyright

  abstract = {Although ophthalmoscopy, fluoro-angiography and ultrasound can usually
	identify most bulbar lesions, CT and MR play a major role in assessing
	the bony orbital structures and the post-bulbar soft tissues. These
	imaging techniques are especially important in investigating the
	eyeball under conditions "blind" to ultrasound not transparent to
	dioptric instruments (blood in the vitreous body, cataract, corneal
	opacity) or to define the site and extension and sometimes the nature
	(melanoma) of tumours. Whereas both CT and MR are completely reliable
	techniques in the study of the orbit, overall CT is decidedly superior
	to MR in the study of bony structures and MR is the method of choice
	in assessing the endo-orbital contents This is because MR offers
	better spatial resolution and contrast with multiplanar views (allowing
	study on three planes without requiring the patient to assume uncomfortable
	positions far coronal CT scanning), greater sensitivity to tissue
	changes and hence diseases, the lack of signal from bony tissue (displaying
	the content of small structures like the orbital apex, nasolacrimal
	fossa and optic canal which are difficult to assess by CT due to
	artefacts) and lastly, the absence of ionizing radiation in examining
	children. These advantages are flanked by the use of the fast-imaging
	technique and surface coils (phased-array) which have overcome the
	limitations originally linked with MR due to the prolonged examination
	times and images degraded by artefacts. Nowadays, the only obstacle
	to routine use of MR is the shortage of MR systems in Italy. For
	both MR and CT scanning, technological developments have led to significant
	advances with the advent of the spiral technique which reduces the
	artefacts of eyeball movements because anatomical volumes can be
	investigated rapidly, improving patient compliance (in acquiring
	coronal scans) and enhancing the qualify of two and three-dimensional
	reconstructions and allowing optimum use of contrast medium as the
	structure can be scanned during the maximum increase phase with a
	reduction in the total amount of contrast administered Although the
	spiral technique is seldom used to examine the orbit in adults given
	the small volume to investigate, it is particular indicated in uncooperative
	patients (children or trauma patients).},

  abstract = {Many evolutionary studies require an understanding of phenotypic change.
	However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary
	levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods
	for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across
	multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical
	procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution.
	The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory
	across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space.
	Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape),
	are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa,
	and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which
	patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa.
	This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns
	of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment
	of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection
	among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic
	trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose
	data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including:
	phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth,
	local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by
	examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of
	Globorotalia.},

  abstract = {Character displacement is typically identified by comparing phenotypic

	phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting
	for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we
	demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric
	character divergence when they are present, and does not identify
	such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements
	and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing
	a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character
	displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for
	other covariates and sources of variation.},

  pages = {393--399},

  abstract = {Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain patterns
	of shape variation and its covariation with other variables. Geometric
	morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape
	variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes
	superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing
	geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing
	environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based
	geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is
	an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark
	data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points,
	curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation
	and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and
	patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph
	is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark
	points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide
	range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary
	hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard
	multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches
	for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more
	specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing
	shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for
	assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions
	are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines
	for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories,
	comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic
	changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available
	advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical
	computing platform.},

  abstract = {A conceptual framework that allows faces to be studied and compared
	objectively with biological validity is presented. The framework
	is a logical extension of modern morphometrics and statistical shape
	analysis techniques. Three dimensional (3D) facial scans were collected
	from 255 healthy young adults. One scan depicted a smiling facial
	expression and another scan depicted a neutral expression. These
	facial scans were modelled in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	space where Euclidean (ED) and Mahalanobis (MD) distances were used
	to form similarity measures. Within this PCA space, property pathways
	were calculated that expressed the direction of change in facial
	expression. Decomposition of distances into property-independent
	(D1) and dependent components (D2) along these pathways enabled the
	comparison of two faces in terms of the extent of a smiling expression.
	The performance of all distances was tested and compared in dual
	types of experiments: Classification tasks and a Recognition task.
	In the Classification tasks, individual facial scans were assigned
	to one or more population groups of smiling or neutral scans. The
	property-dependent (D2) component of both Euclidean and Mahalanobis
	distances performed best in the Classification task, by correctly
	assigning 99.8% of scans to the right population group. The recognition
	task tested if a scan of an individual depicting a smiling/neutral
	expression could be positively identified when shown a scan of the
	same person depicting a neutral/smiling expression. ED1 and MD1 performed
	best, and correctly identified 97.8% and 94.8% of individual scans
	respectively as belonging to the same person despite differences
	in facial expression. It was concluded that decomposed components
	are superior to straightforward distances in achieving positive identifications
	and presents a novel method for quantifying facial similarity. Additionally,
	although the undecomposed Mahalanobis distance often used in practice
	outperformed that of the Euclidean, it was the opposite result for
	the decomposed distances.},

	used multivariate statistical techniques for assessing the comparative
	morphology of living and fossil primates. Some common pitfalls of
	these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring
	the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of
	the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted
	approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities
	of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities),
	and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate
	ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric
	affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses
	with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To
	better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances,
	the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series
	of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data
	space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer
	canonical variates are emphasized. Simple examples taken from the
	literature illustrate how the different approaches to including a
	fosil in canonical variate analysis may affect the multivariate results
	upon which physical anthropologists base their interpretations of

  abstract = {We show how to extend the ICP framework to nonrigid registration,
	while retaining the convergence properties of the original algorithm.
	The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use
	of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable
	stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing
	stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards
	the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations.
	To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative
	closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated
	by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template
	for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated.
	Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by
	searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm
	using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation
	to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation
	of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation
	the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness
	can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for
	a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly.
	It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms
	using synthetic examples and real world data.},

  abstract = {Variation in cranial robusticity among modern human populations is
	widely acknowledged but not well-understood. While the use of ldquorobustrdquo
	cranial traits in hominin systematics and phylogeny suggests that
	these characters are strongly heritable, this hypothesis has not
	been tested. Alternatively, cranial robusticity may be a response
	to differences in diet/mastication or it may be an adaptation to
	cold, harsh environments. This study quantifies the distribution
	of cranial robusticity in 14 geographically widespread human populations,
	and correlates this variation with climatic variables, neutral genetic
	distances, cranial size, and cranial shape. With the exception of
	the occipital torus region, all traits were positively correlated
	with each other, suggesting that they should not be treated as individual
	characters. While males are more robust than females within each
	of the populations, among the independent variables (cranial shape,
	size, climate, and neutral genetic distances), only shape is significantly
	correlated with inter-population differences in robusticity. Two-block
	partial least-squares analysis was used to explore the relationship
	between cranial shape (captured by three-dimensional landmark data)
	and robusticity across individuals. Weak support was found for the
	hypothesis that robusticity was related to mastication as the shape
	associated with greater robusticity was similar to that described
	for groups that ate harder-to-process diets. Specifically, crania
	with more prognathic faces, expanded glabellar and occipital regions,
	and (slightly) longer skulls were more robust than those with rounder
	vaults and more orthognathic faces. However, groups with more mechanically
	demanding diets (hunter-gatherers) were not always more robust than
	groups practicing some form of agriculture. Am J Phys Anthropol,

  abstract = {Study of morphological form is fundamental to the discipline of paleoanthropology.
	The size and shape of our ancestors' anatomical features have long
	been the focus of research on hominin systematics, phylogeny, functional
	morphology, ontogeny, variation, and evolutionary change. Early physical
	anthropologists relied on both qualitative descriptions of anatomical
	shape and linear measurements to assess variation among hominins.
	The seminal works of W. W. Howells1 and C. E. Oxnard2 helped to bring
	multivariate techniques to the forefront of physical anthropology.
	Howells' intention was the objective delineation of components of
	shape, which could then fuel further analyses and interpretations,
	as well as clarification of the ways that growth influences interindividual
	and interpopulational differences in shape. He expressed concern
	that previous comparisons of individual measurements did not capture
	the overall shape of the skull, which is expressed by the relations
	between measurements.1:3 Similarly, Oxnard recognized that a multivariate
	approach to the study of complex shapes allows for such perturbations
	(e.g., variation and covariation)that are difficult to evaluate by
	eye and impossible to reveal by measurement and simple analysis alone.2:6
	While multivariate methods offered clear advantages over univariate
	or bivariate representations of shape, the analysis of traditional
	morphometric measures such as linear distances, angles, and ratios,
	has limitations when it comes to quantifying the complex geometry
	of some anatomical structures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Computed Tomography (CT) represents the standard method for tumor
	volume delineation, despite some inherent limitations. CT scan is
	very useful in providing information on physical density for dose
	calculation and morphological volumetric information but presents
	a low sensitivity in assessing the tumor viability. On the other
	hand, 3D ultrasound (US) allows a high accurate definition of the
	tumor volume thanks to its high spatial resolution but it is not
	currently integrated in the treatment planning but used only for
	diagnosis and follow-up. Our ultimate goal is an automatic segmentation
	of gross tumor volume (GTV) in the 3D US, the segmentation of the
	organs at risk (OAR) in the CT and the registration of both. In this
	paper, we present some preliminary results in this direction. We
	present 3D active contour-based segmentation of the eye ball and
	the lens in CT images; the presented approach incorporates the prior
	knowledge of the anatomy by using a 3D geometrical eye model. The
	automated segmentation results are validated by comparing with manual
	segmentations. Then, for the fusion of 3D CT and US images, we present
	two approaches: (i) landmark-based transformation, and (ii) object-based
	transformation that makes use of eye ball contour information on
	CT and US images.},

	methods can be used to exclude identifications; however, they should

  abstract = {The cranial airways are in the center of the human face. Therefore
	variation in the size and shape of these central craniofacial structures
	could have important consequences for the surrounding midfacial morphology
	during development and evolution. Yet such interactions are unclear
	because one school of thought, based on experimental and developmental
	evidence, suggests a relative independence (modularity) of these
	two facial compartments, whereas another one assumes tight morphological
	integration. This study uses geometric morphometrics of modern humans
	and 40 three-dimensional-landmarks of the skeletal nasopharynx and
	nasal cavity and outer midfacial skeleton to analyze these questions
	in terms of modularity. The sizes of all facial compartments were
	all strongly correlated. Shape integration was high between the cranial
	airways and the outer midfacial skeleton and between the latter and
	the anterior airway openings (skeletal regions close to and including
	piriform aperture). However, no shape integration was detected between
	outer midface and posterior airway openings (nasopharynx and choanae).
	Similarly, no integration was detected between posterior and anterior
	airway openings. This may reflect functional modularization of nasal
	cavity compartments related to respiratory physiology and differential
	developmental interactions with the face. Airway size likely relates
	to the energetics of the organism, whereas airways shape might be
	more indicative of respiratory physiology and climate. Although this
	hypothesis should be addressed in future steps, here we suggest that
	selection on morphofunctional characteristics of the cranial airways
	could have cascading effects for the variation, development, and
	evolution of the human face. Am J Phys Anthropol 152:287-293, 2013.

	inferior limits of facial compartments, contribute to the orientation
	of the viscerocranium in the primate skull. In humans, vertical facial
	variation is among the main sources of diversity and frequently associated
	with an integrated suite of other cranio-mandibular traits. Facial
	heights and kyphosis are also important factors in interspecific
	variation and models of hominoid evolution. The ontogenctic determination
	of adult facial orientation and its relation to phylogenetic variation
	are unclear, but crucial in all previously mentioned respects. We
	addressed these issues in a sample of 175 humans and chimpanzees
	with Procrustes based geometric morphometrics, testing hypotheses
	of interspecific similarity in postnatal ontogenetic trajectories,
	early versus later ontogenetic facial pattern determination, and
	a developmental model of morphological integration. We analyzed the
	contribution of postnatal morphogenesis to adult vertical facial
	variation by partitioning morphological variation into a portion
	of pure growth allometry and a non-allometric, fraction. A statistically
	significant difference of growth-allometries revealed that in both
	species growth established the adult skull proportions by vertical
	facial expansion, but while in chimpanzees the complete viscerocranium
	showed reorientation, in humans only the lower face was modified.
	In both species the results support a hypothesis of early facial
	pattern determination. A coincident emergence of morphological traits
	favors a hypothesis of developmental integration of the face, excluding
	traits of the basi- and neurocranium. Interspecific differences in
	integration may have implications for evolutionary studies. The present
	findings indicate that growth establishes the adult skull proportions
	and integrates principal facial orientation patterns, already there
	in early postnatal ontogeny. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	can occur synchronously with changes in the environment, and sexual
	dimorphism of the mandible can be influenced by the environment.
	Sexual dimorphism during the last 1200 years was evaluated using
	geometric morphometric analysis of virtual cranial models. The method
	of geometric morphometrics allows differences in size and shape to
	be assessed separately. We analyzed groups of adult individuals dating
	to Early Middle Ages, High Middle Ages, Early Modern Ages and from
	a modern Czech population (21st century). Significant sexual dimorphism
	in mandibular size was found in all populations. A trend in the sexual
	dimorphism of size was seen, with differences between the sexes increasing
	gradually over time. Size changes in female mandibles were a better
	reflection of environmental conditions and climate than size changes
	in male mandibles. Regarding changes in the sexual dimorphism of
	shape, significant dimorphism was found in all four samples. However,
	the pattern of mandibular shape dimorphism was different and varied
	considerably between samples. There was only one stable shape trait
	showing sexual dimorphism across all four samples in our study: the
	gonion lies more laterally in male than in female mandibles and male
	mandibles are relatively wider than female mandibles. Sexual dimorphism
	of shape is not influenced by the climate; instead sexual selection
	might play a role. This research supports earlier studies that have
	found that the degree and pattern of sexual dimorphism is population-specific
	and the factors regulating sexual dimorphism today may not be the
	same as those in the past.},

	of wing shape showed significant differences between sexes and sites.
	The geometric variation demonstrated that the points at the intersection
	of radial and cubital-anal veins might be key characters to differentiate
	between sexes. This study also showed the presence of two clearly
	different male morphotypes coexisting in the same study site. However,
	it should be noted that the results of this study showed that the
	variation in wing shape is an analytical character in the determination
	of sexual differences in the family Ichneumonidae. These differences
	raise the question of whether sexual dimorphism of wing shape may
	be modulated by natural selection.},

  abstract = {Ontogenetic studies of African ape skulls lead to an analysis of morphological
	differences in terms of allometry, heterochrony, and sexual dimorphism.
	The use of geometric morphometrics allows us 1) to define size and
	shape variations as independent factors (an essential but seldom
	respected condition for heterochrony), and 2) to calculate in percentage
	of shape changes and to graphically represent the parts of shape
	variation which are related to various biological phenomena: common
	allometry, intraspecific allometry, and allometric and nonallometric
	shape discrimination. Three tridimensional Procrustes analyses and
	the calculation of multivariate allometries, discriminant functions,
	and statistical tests are used to compare the skulls of 50 Pan troglodytes,
	and 50 Gorilla gorilla of different dental stages. The results both
	complement and modify classical results obtained from similar material
	but with different methods. Size and Scaling in Primate Morphology,
	New York: Plenum, p. 175-205). As previously described by Shea, the
	common growth allometric pattern is very important (64\% of total
	shape variation). It corresponds to a larger increase of facial volume
	than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum,
	and a noticeable reshaping of the nuchal region (higher inion). However,
	the heterochronic interpretation based on common allometry is rather
	different from Shea. Gorillas differ from chimpanzees not only with
	a larger magnitude of allometric change (rate peramorphosis), as
	is classically said, but also grow more in size than in shape (size
	acceleration). In other words, for a similar stage of growth, gorillas
	have the size and shape corresponding to older chimpanzees, and for
	a similar shape, gorillas have a larger size than chimpanzees. In
	contrast, sexual dimorphism actually corresponds to allometric changes
	only, as classically demonstrated (time hypermorphosis). Sexual dimorphism
	is here significant in adult gorillas alone, and solely in terms
	of allometry (size-related shape and size, given that sagittal and
	nuchal crests are not taken into account). The study also permits
	us to differentiate two different shape variations that are classically
	confused in ontogenetic studies: a very small part of allometric
	shape change which is specific to each species (1\% of the total
	shape variation), and nonallometric species-specific traits independent
	of growth (8\% of total shape change). When calculated in terms of
	intraspecific allometries (including common allometry and noncommon
	allometry), shape changes are more extensive in gorillas (36\% of
	total shape change) than in chimpanzees (29\% of total shape change).
	The allometric differences mainly concern the inion, which becomes
	higher; the position of the foramen magnum, more dorsally oriented;
	and the palate, more tilted in adult gorillas than in adult chimpanzees.
	In contrast, nonallometric species-specific traits in gorillas are
	the long and flat vault characterized by a prominent occipital region,
	the higher and displaced backward glabella, and the protrusive nose.
	Biomechanical schemes built from shape partition suggest that the
	increased out-of-plumb position of the head during growth is partially
	compensated in gorillas by a powerful nuchal musculature due to the
	peculiar shape of the occipital region.},

	It is highly debated to what extent this variability has accumulated

	genetic differentiation, we quantify the relative role of drift versus

	in shaping the human cranium. We further demonstrate that a large
	proportion of the signal for natural selection comes from populations
	from extremely cold regions. More generally, we show that, if drift

  abstract = {The socioeconomic structure of an early medieval society from the
	Mikulice settlement (Czech Republic) was studied on the basis of
	an evaluation of the fluctuating and directional asymmetry (DA) of
	skulls. Two distinct inhabited regions, castle and sub-castle, were
	compared. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was used as a bioindicator of
	environmental stress, which is thought to have been different in
	the Mikulice castle and sub-castle regions. DA is consistent with
	biomechanical loading, and it was expected to reflect different subsistence
	patterns. The material consisted of 129 crania from what was presumed
	to be a higher socioeconomic class (Mikulice castle) and 71 crania
	from middle and lower socioeconomic classes (Mikulice sub-castle).
	As a comparative sample, 138 crania from modern, lower socioeconomic
	classes (Pachner Collection) were used. The three-dimensional coordinates
	of 68 landmarks were digitized and analyzed using geometric morphometrics.
	In terms of DA, the highest values were recorded in the sub-castle
	sample and confirmed their lower socioeconomic position, with a grittier
	and lower protein diet compared with the castle sample. In terms
	of FA, distinctive differences between the sexes were found. In males,
	no differences were observed between castle and sub-castle, and the
	lowest FA values were recorded. In females, significantly higher
	values of FA were found, surprisingly in the castle sample, comparable
	with the more stressed Pachner Collection. We suspect that the FA
	reflects a more varied population of castle females as a consequence
	of patrilocality, although environmental stress remains a possibility.

	Eskimo) are used in this evaluation of a discriminant functional
	analysis for determining race and sex from eight cranial measurements.
	The methods used are those given by Giles and Elliot ('62). The study
	shows that non-deformed American Indian crania are racially misclassified
	as American White and Negro in 35.6% of the cases when using this
	metrical method. Deformed Indian crania are racially misclassified
	60.0% and 4.4% of the time as White and Negro respectively. The determination
	of sex on male crania, regardless of deformation, is as accurate
	as, or better than, the visual method of identification. The female
	crania, however, are shown to be incorrectly sexed in nearly 50%
	of the cases, with one non-deformed group (Palus) running as high
	as 80.0%. This evaluation suggests, therefore, that discriminant
	functional analyses for race and / or sex determinations are not
	applicable to problems of human identification unless the crania
	are from that population on which these functions were established.},

  abstract = {At the core of contemporary morphometrics--the quantitative study
	of biological shape variation--is a synthesis of two originally divergent
	methodological styles. One contributory tradition is the multivariate
	analysis of covariance matrices originally developed as biometrics
	and now dominant across a broad expanse of applied statistics. This
	approach, couched solely in the linear geometry of covariance structures,
	ignores biomathematical aspects of the original measurements. The
	other tributary emphasizes the direct visualization of changes in
	biological form. However, making objective the biological meaning
	of the features seen in those diagrams was always problematical;
	also, the representation of variation, as distinct from pairwise
	difference, proved infeasible. To combine these two variants of biomathematical
	modeling into a valid praxis for quantitative studies of biological
	shape was a goal earnestly sought though most of this century. That
	goal was finally achieved in the 1980s when techniques from mathematical
	statistics, multivariate biometrics, non-Euclidean geometry and computer
	graphics were combined in a coherent new system of tools for the
	complete regionalized quantitative analysis of landmark points together
	with the biomedical images in which they are seen. In this morphometric
	synthesis, correspondence of landmarks (biologically labeled geometric
	points, like "bridge of the nose") across specimens is taken as a
	biomathematical primitive. The shapes of configurations of landmarks
	are defined as equivalence classes with respect to the Euclidean
	similarity group and then represented as single points in David Kendall's
	shape space, a Riemannian manifold with Procrustes distance as metric.
	All conventional multivariate strategies carry over to the study
	of shape variation and covariation when shapes are interpreted in
	the tangent space to the shape manifold at an average shape. For
	biomathematical interpretation of such analyses, one needs a basis
	for the tangent space compatible with the reality of local biotheoretical
	processes and explanations at many different geometric scales, and
	one needs graphics for visualizing average shape differences and
	other statistical contrasts there. Both of these needs are managed
	by the thin-plate spline, a deformation function that has an unusually
	helpful linear algebra. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks
	to deformation analysis of the images from which the landmarks originally
	arose. This article reviews the history and principal tools of this
	synthesis in their biomathematical and biometrical context and demonstrates
	their usefulness in a study of focal neuroanatomical anomalies in
	schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {In many current medical applications of image analysis, objects are
	detected and delimited by boundary curves or surfaces. Yet the most
	effective multivariate statistics available pertain to labeled points
	(landmarks) only. In the finite-dimensional feature space that landmarks
	support, each case of a data set is equivalent to a deformation map
	deriving it from the average form. This paper introduces a new extension
	of the finite-dimensional spline-based approach for incorporating
	edge information. In this implementation edgels are restricted to
	landmark loci: they are interpreted as pairs of landmarks at infinitesimal
	separation in a specific direction. The effect of changing edge direction
	is a singular perturbation of the thin-plate spline for the landmarks
	alone. An appropriate normalization yields a basis for image deformations
	corresponding to changes of edge direction without landmark movement;
	this basis complements the basis of landmark deformations ignoring
	edge information. We derive explicit formulas for these edge warps,
	evaluate the quadratic form expressing bending energies of their
	formal combinations, and show the resulting spectrum of edge features
	in typical scenes. These expressions will aid all investigations

	There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups.
	We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive
	and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the
	variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline
	curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions
	from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15
	with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5
	h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings
	pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross
	motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed
	by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior
	by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly
	more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With
	the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles
	of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE
	distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum
	is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one
	that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two
	combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed

  abstract = {Anthropometry of the face has always been an interesting subject for
	artists and plastic surgeons. Since ancient times, many rules have
	been proposed for the ideal face. The authors measured directly vertical
	and horizontal proportions of the face and inclinations of the soft-tissue
	facial profile in 1050 young Turkish adults. Differences between
	the facial measurements of subjects from seven different geographic
	regions were analyzed. Some of the measurements were compared further
	with the measurements of other populations in the literature, and
	the validity of the neoclassical canons were tested. The special
	head height measure was shorter than the special face height in the
	majority of our study group (women/men: equal height, 13%/15%; longer
	special head height, 28%/30%; shorter special head height, 59%/55%).
	Faces with three equally high-profile sections were not seen in women
	or in men. When the forehead height was compared with the nose height,
	equality was present in a small percentage of the population (women/men:
	equal height, 17%/18%; longer forehead, 41%/42%; shorter forehead,
	42%/40%). The nose height was equal to the lower face height in a
	minority of the population (women/men: equal height, 10%/11%; longer
	nose, 9%/11%; shorter nose (81%/78%). The forehead height was shorter
	than the lower face height in the majority of the population (women/men:
	equal height, 8%/9%; longer forehead, 12%/13%; shorter forehead,
	79%/78%). The intercanthal distance was shorter than the nose width
	in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width, 20%/19%;
	wider intercanthal distance, 35%/37%; narrower intercanthal width,
	65%/68%). The population was distributed evenly in regard to the
	variations of the orbital proportion canon (women/men: equal intercanthal
	width and eye fissure length, 31%/36%; wider intercanthal distance,
	34%/27%; narrower intercanthal width, 35%/37%). The mouth width was
	greater than 1.5 times the nose width in the majority of the population
	(women/men: equal width, 6%/5%; wider mouth, 53%/54%; narrower mouth,
	41%/41%). The nose width was narrower than one quarter of the face
	width in the majority of the population (women/men: equal width,
	4%/3%; wider nose, 30%/39%; narrower nose, 66%/58%). The nose inclination
	was equal to the ear inclination in a very small fraction of subjects
	(women/men: equal inclination, 3%/3%; greater nose inclination, 88%/87%;
	less nose inclination, 9%/9%). To sketch an outline of the average
	facial profile in the population studied, a convex facial profile
	is revealed, with the forehead and the chin retrodisplaced minimally
	with respect to the midface. The neoclassical canons were found to
	be invalid for the majority of the population in this study, and
	different proportional analytic results were obtained.},

  abstract = {The extent to which faces depicted as surfaces devoid of pigmentation
	and with minimal texture cues ('head models') could be matched with
	photographs (when unfamiliar) and identified (when familiar) was
	examined in three experiments. The head models were obtained by scanning
	the three-dimensional surface of the face with a laser, and by displaying
	the surface measured in this way by using standard computer-aided
	design techniques. Performance in all tasks was above chance but
	far from ceiling. Experiment 1 showed that matching of unfamiliar
	head models with photographs was affected by the resolution with
	which the surface was displayed, suggesting that subjects based their
	decisions, at least in part, on three-dimensional surface structure.
	Matching accuracy was also affected by other factors to do with the
	view points shown in the head models and test photographs, and the
	type of lighting used to portray the head model. In experiment 2
	further evidence for the importance of the nature of the illumination
	used was obtained, and it was found that the addition of a hairstyle
	(not that of the target face) did not facilitate matching. In experiment
	3 identification of the head models by colleagues of the people shown
	was compared with identification of photographs where the hair was
	concealed and eyes were closed. Head models were identified less
	well than these photographs, suggesting that the difficulties in
	their recognition are not solely due to the lack of hair. Women's
	heads were disproportionately difficult to recognise from the head
	models. The results are discussed in terms of their implications
	for the use of such three-dimensional head models in forensic and
	surgical applications.},

	largely influenced by the allometric variations associated with the
	increase in the relative cranial capacity. In the human genus, the
	changes in the face, base, and neurocranium are characterised by
	a mosaic variation, in which adaptations, secondary consequences,
	and stochastic factors concur to generate a set of anatomical possibilities

	extracted from 46 computer tomography scans and captured by the statistical

	the bony orbit resembles a four-sided pyramid that becomes three-sided
	near the apex, with a volume of approximately 30 cm(3). The adult
	orbital rim measures, on average, 40 mm horizontally and 35 mm vertically,
	with the widest dimension of the orbit 1 cm behind the anterior orbital
	rim. The medial walls are roughly parallel and are 25 rum apart in
	adults. The length of the medial orbital wall from the anterior lacrimal
	crest is 45 to 50 mm, whereas the lateral wall from the rim to the
	superior orbital fissure measures 40 mm [1,2]. The lateral orbital
	walls are angled 90 degrees from each other. The lateral orbital
	rim is approximately at the level of the equator of the globe. The
	globe has an average volume of 6.5 cm(3) and has a shape formed by
	two spheres, the cornea and the sclera, with radius of curvatures
	equal to 8 and 12 mm, respectively [2]. Globes in the average adult
	and newborn infant measure 24 mm and 16.4 mm, respectively, in the
	anteroposterior dimension.},

	With age, or because of genetic disposition, the eyeball descends,
	reducing the space between it and the floor of the orbit. This will
	inevitably cause forward projection of the extraconical orbital fat,
	creating herniated fat pads and resulting in enophthalmia. Based
	on the volume of the bony orbit and its contents, it is likely that
	relocating, rather then removing, herniated fat pads will greatly
	improve and prevent the enophthalmia of aging and give the globe
	a position and a projection of youth. Based on the results of surgery
	using the capsulopalpebral flap, it is likely that a descended Lockwood
	suspensory ligament, rather than a weakened orbital septum, is the
	cause of herniated fat pads and enophthalmia. We feel neither a weakened
	orbital septum nor an overabundance of orbital fat nor a shallow
	orbit is responsible for either of these conditions. We give a detailed

	fat pads, and manage and prevent enophthalmia and obtain a beautiful,

	with its central role in the study of biodiversity and evolution,
	and the "revolution" in morphometrics brought about by methods based
	on the analysis of Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks,
	the use of geometric morphometrics in biogeographic studies has been
	rather limited. With this analysis we aim to provide an example of
	how geometric morphometrics can fruitfully be applied to the study
	of clinal variation in a widespread African monkey group by a simple
	extension of methods widely employed by macroecologists and biogeographers
	to multivariate shape data. Throughout the paper we aim to explain
	these techniques so that those who are new to them can use and adapt
	them for their own needs, in some cases providing specific instructions
	on how to perform certain operations in standard morphometrics and
	statistical software. Our hope is that this may stimulate morphometricians
	and scientists from other disciplines to explore geographic variation
	in size and shape using up-to-date geometric morphometric methods.
	The application of geometric morphometrics to ecological, biogeographic
	and phylogeographic studies has enormous potential for a thorough
	understanding of how form changes in space and time during evolution
	and in relation to genetic and environmental factors.},

	of the field, with particular reference to the past 5 years. Such
	developments are discussed in a sectorial manner, distinguishing
	the role of research in the areas of forensic anthropology which
	deal with human remains and those that deal with the living. As regards
	the "human remains" domain, advances and stalls still present in
	the fields of species and postmortem interval determination, sexing,
	aging and attribution of ancestry are stressed. The need for standards
	in facial reconstruction and positive identification by bone morphology
	are underlined, as well as the growing role of the anthropologist
	in detecting signs of trauma. Finally, the relatively new role of
	the forensic anthropologist in the domain of identification of the
	living is described, although this area is still underrepresented
	as regards research activity: these studies concern the strive to
	devise methods for identifying faces (e.g. in the case of crimes
	registered by videosurveillance systems), aging living individuals
	or juveniles represented in pedopornographic material.},

	to carry out geometric morphometric assessments to localize alterations,
	using Procrustes analysis and thin-plate spline analysis, in addition
	to conventional cephalometric techniques. Procrustes analysis indicated
	that the mean craniofacial, midfacial and mandibular morphology was

	T-2-test of cephalometric variables. Mandibular prognathism demonstrated
	a shorter and slightly retropositioned maxilla, a greater total length
	and anterior positioning of the mandible. Thin-plate spline analysis
	revealed a developmental diminution of the palatomaxillary region
	anteroposteriorly and a developmental elongation of the mandible
	anteroposteriorly, leading to the appearance of a prognathic mandibular
	profile. In conclusion, thin-plate spline analysis seems to provide
	a valuable supplement for conventional cephalometric analysis because

  abstract = {Purpose: To describe the metric measurements and normal anatomic variants
	in Chinese bony orbits. Methods: Orbital osteology was studied in
	194 orbits from 97 Chinese skulls. Morphologic observations and metric
	measurements were made to elucidate the variations of the orbital
	bony anatomy and to localize important fissures and foramina within
	the orbit. Sexual dimorphism and side asymmetry of orbital features
	were analyzed. Results were then compared with data from other populations.
	Results: The details of the orbital osteology in Chinese are described.
	Most orbital features show anatomic variations in terms of their
	existence, quantity, and location. Anatomic variants including quadruple
	and extrasutural posterior ethmoidal foramen are described for the
	first time. Side asymmetry and sexual dimorphism (male, larger than
	female) are demonstrated in some orbital features. Compared with
	white and American populations, orbital measurements are generally
	smaller in Chinese, probably related to their smaller orbital size.
	Conclusions: The Chinese orbital osteology demonstrates considerable
	variability. The newly described anatomic variants found on the posterior
	ethmoidal foramen may affect surgical procedures related to the medial
	orbital wall. Sexual dimorphism and ethnic variations of the orbital
	bony anatomy may affect surgical approach to orbital diseases in
	different populations.},

  abstract = {Forensic facial reconstruction aims at estimating the facial outlook
	associated with an unidentified skull specimen. Estimation is generally
	based on tabulated average values of soft tissue thicknesses measured
	at a sparse set of landmarks on the skull. Traditional [`]plastic'
	methods apply modeling clay or plasticine on a cast of the skull,
	approximating the estimated tissue depths at the landmarks and interpolating
	in between. Current computerized techniques mimic this landmark interpolation
	procedure using a single static facial surface template. However,
	the resulting reconstruction is biased by the specific choice of
	the template and no face-specific regularization is used during the
	interpolation process. We reduce the template bias by using a flexible
	statistical model of a dense set of facial surface points, combined
	with an associated sparse set of skull-based landmarks. This statistical
	model is constructed from a facial database of (N = 118) individuals
	and limits the reconstructions to statistically plausible outlooks.
	The actual reconstruction is obtained by fitting the skull-based
	landmarks of the template model to the corresponding landmarks indicated
	on a digital copy of the skull to be reconstructed. The fitting process
	changes the face-specific statistical model parameters in a regularized
	way and interpolates the remaining landmark fit error using a minimal
	bending thin-plate spline (TPS)-based deformation. Furthermore, estimated
	properties of the skull specimen (BMI, age and gender, e.g.) can
	be incorporated as conditions on the reconstruction by removing property-related
	shape variation from the statistical model description before the
	fitting process. The proposed statistical method is validated, both
	in terms of accuracy and identification success rate, based on leave-one-out
	cross-validation tests applied on the facial database. Accuracy results
	are obtained by statistically analyzing the local 3D facial surface
	differences of the reconstructions and their corresponding ground
	truth. Identification success rate is obtained by comparing, based
	on correlation, Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) signatures of the
	reconstructed and the original 3D facial surfaces in the database.
	A subjective identification success rate is quantified based on face-pool
	tests. Finally a qualitative comparison is made between facial reconstructions
	of a real-case skull, based on two typical static face models and
	our statistical model, showing the shortcomings of current face models
	and the improved performance of the statistical model.},

  abstract = {Forensic craniofacial reconstruction (CFR) aims at estimating the
	facial outlook associated to an unknown skull for victim identification.
	Computerized CFR techniques are essentially a virtual mimicking of
	manual CFR techniques and all share the same conceptual model-based
	framework. We propose a fully automated Bayesian based statistical
	framework estimating the most probable face, according to a known
	craniofacial model (CFM), given the, possibly inaccurate, skull data.
	A multivariate Gaussian distribution is assumed for the shape parameters
	of the CFM, only allowing face-like solutions. The CFM is improved
	by encoding tissue depth differently as an extra value for 52 landmarks
	on the face and by incorporating gray-valued texture information.
	A fully automated and consistent technique is obtained by the use
	of an implicit target skull representation (TSR). The most plausible
	face associated to the target skull is calculated using an expectation-maximization
	procedure that is robust to small (noise) and/or gross errors (outliers).
	A clinical database of 12 individuals is used for simulating realistic
	reconstruction scenarios. Validation is performed in terms of reconstruction
	accuracy and recognition success. Within the same EM reconstruction
	framework, the proposed procedure is compared to alternative reconstructions
	using different target skull representations and different CFMs incorporating
	various amounts of covariance. The results indicate that the proposed
	CFM performs better than the other models. Furthermore, the use of
	the implicit TSR generates more consistent and better results compared
	to a realistic landmark based skull representation. Finally, these
	results also confirm that the Bayesian framework formulation is indeed
	robust against noise and outliers in the skull data.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of facial sexual dimorphism is useful to understanding
	facial anatomy and specifically how faces influence, and have been
	influenced by, sexual selection. An important facial aspect is the
	display of bilateral symmetry, invoking the need to investigate aspects
	of symmetry and asymmetry separately when examining facial shape.
	Previous studies typically employed landmarks that provided only
	a sparse facial representation, where different landmark choices
	could lead to contrasting outcomes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism
	is only tested as a difference of sample means, which is statistically
	the same as a difference in population location only. Within the
	framework of geometric morphometrics, we partition facial shape,
	represented in a spatially dense way, into patterns of symmetry and
	asymmetry, following a two-factor anova design. Subsequently, we
	investigate sexual dimorphism in symmetry and asymmetry patterns
	separately, and on multiple aspects, by examining (i) population
	location differences as well as differences in population variance-covariance;
	(ii) scale; and (iii) orientation. One important challenge in this
	approach is the proportionally high number of variables to observations
	necessitating the implementation of permutational and computationally
	feasible statistics. In a sample of gender-matched young adults (18-25 years)
	with self-reported European ancestry, we found greater variation
	in male faces than in women for all measurements. Statistically significant
	sexual dimorphism was found for the aspect of location in both symmetry
	and asymmetry (directional asymmetry), for the aspect of scale only
	in asymmetry (magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry) and, in contrast,
	for the aspect of orientation only in symmetry. Interesting interplays
	with hypotheses in evolutionary and developmental biology were observed,
	such as the selective nature of the force underpinning sexual dimorphism
	and the genetic independence of the structural patterns of fluctuating
	asymmetry. Additionally, insights into growth patterns of the soft
	tissue envelope of the face and underlying skull structure can also
	be obtained from the results.},

  abstract = {Mild facial asymmetries are common in typical growth patterns. Therefore,
	detection of disordered facial growth patterns in individuals characterized
	by asymmetries is preferably accomplished by reference to the typical
	variation found in the general population rather than to some ideal
	of perfect symmetry, which rarely exists. This presents a challenge
	in developing an asymmetry assessment tool that is applicable, without
	modification, to detect both mild and severe facial asymmetries.
	In this paper we use concepts from geometric morphometrics to obtain
	robust and spatially-dense asymmetry assessments using a superimposition
	protocol for comparison of a face with its mirror image. Spatially-dense
	localization of asymmetries was achieved using an anthropometric
	mask consisting of uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks that were automatically
	indicated on 3D facial images. Robustness, in the sense of an unbiased
	analysis under increasing asymmetry, was ensured by an adaptive,
	robust, least-squares superimposition. The degree of overall asymmetry
	in an individual was scored using a root-mean-squared-error, and
	the proportion was scored using a novel relative significant asymmetry
	percentage. This protocol was applied to a database of 3D facial
	images from 359 young healthy individuals and three individuals with
	disordered facial growth. Typical asymmetry statistics were derived
	and were mainly located on, but not limited to, the lower two-thirds
	of the face in males and females. The asymmetry in males was more
	extensive and of a greater magnitude than in females. This protocol
	and proposed scoring of asymmetry with accompanying reference statistics
	will be useful for the detection and quantification of facial asymmetry
	in future studies.},

	Objectives To accomplish a large population based study that would
	accurately determine normative PF values across the full diversity
	of the Canadian school age population.
	
	Methods A normative sample of school age children was identified in
	Vancouver, British Columbia and Winnipeg, Manitoba to reflect the
	diversity of racial and national groups in Canada. The sample included
	students in grades 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 from 17 schools in Vancouver
	and 31 schools in Winnipeg. Schools were selected based on racial
	diversity obtained from data from the 2001 Statistics Canada census.
	1064 students in Vancouver and 1033 students in Winnipeg were photographed
	in a standardized way. Photographs were analyzed using a computerized
	method.
	
	Results Analysis demonstrated that PFs do grow with age and there
	is a slight but meaningful difference between boys and girls in each
	age group. It is possible to define Canadian standards without reference
	to racial or ethnic origin.
	
	Conclusion Mean results with norms and standard deviations are presented
	in figures for clinical use and are clinically smaller than those
	found in the most commonly used reference book.},

	French military population, in order to constitute two samples of
	30 males and 30 females for the stereometric survey. For each subject,
	the stereorestitution of face photos was made on three sets of data:
	(1) 37 anatomical landmarks previously identified by a black point
	marked on the face; (2) 7 anatomical arcs, also drawn with a black
	pencil; and (3) 1500 - 2000 points distributed on horizontal cross-sections
	at different vertical levels. <br /><br />The analysis only concerned
	the global face shape, and excluded the central area (eyes, nose
	and mouth). A common origin and reference axis system was defined.
	All the three-dimensional (3D) produced data was processed using
	computer-aided design software, after some adaptations. Subjects
	were selected iteratively for five levels of cross-section and three
	anatomical arcs so as to characterize least variation amplitudes,

	were verified to check the validity of the preceding step. By this
	method, each group was defined by a mean profile form and by the
	amplitude of this form for each point of the profile. Males and females
	were present in each group, and for each group, a greater variability
	was noted at the lower part of the face. This variability can be
	explained as the result of morphological and functional phenomena.

	problematic to recover image structure reliably, without a model
	to organise the often noisy and incomplete image evidence. The key
	problem is that of variability. To be useful, a model needs to be
	specific - that is, to be capable of representing only 'legal' examples
	of the modelled object(s). It has proved difficult to achieve this
	whilst allowing for natural variability. Recent developments have
	overcome this problem; it has been shown that specific patterns of
	variability inshape and grey-level appearance can be captured by
	statistical models that can be used directly in image interpretation.This
	document describes methods of building models of shape and appearance,
	and how such models can be used to interpret images.},

  journal = {American Journal of Physical Anthropology},
  year = {2011},

  pages = {192--202},
  abstract = {Abstract The present study investigates whether the human mandible
	is sexually dimorphic during early postnatal development and whether
	early dimorphic features persist during subsequent ontogeny. We also
	examine whether mandibular dimorphism is linked to dimorphism of
	dental development. Dense CT-derived mandibular meshes of 84 females
	and 75 males, ranging from birth to adulthood, were analyzed using
	geometric morphometric methods. On the basis of the specimen's chronological
	ages and mineralization stages of the deciduous and permanent teeth,
	we compute dental age as proxy for dental development by the additive
	conjoint measurement method. By birth, males have, on average, more
	advanced age-specific shapes than females. However, sex differences
	decrease quickly as females catch up via a different association
	between shape and size. This leads to an almost complete reduction
	of sexual dimorphism between the ages of 4 and 14. From puberty to
	adulthood, males are characterized by allometric shape changes while
	the shape of the female mandible continues to change even after size
	has ceased to increase. Dimorphism of dental maturation becomes visible
	only at puberty. Sexual dimorphism, concentrated at the ramus and
	the mental region during the earliest ontogenetic stages and again
	at adulthood, is not associated with the development of the teeth.
	At puberty there is a simultaneous peak in size increase, shape development,
	and dental maturation likely controlled by the surge of sex hormones
	with a dimorphic onset age. We argue that the infant and adult dimorphism
	of the mental region may be associated with the development of supralaryngeal
	structures. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most supervised classification methods are limited by
	the requirement for more cases than variables. In microarray data
	the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of cases (arrays),
	and thus filtering and pre-selection of genes is required. We describe
	the application of Between Group Analysis (BGA) to the analysis of
	microarray data. A feature of BGA is that it can be used when the
	number of variables (genes) exceeds the number of cases (arrays).
	BGA is based on carrying out an ordination of groups of samples,
	using a standard method such as Correspondence Analysis (COA), rather
	than an ordination of the individual microarray samples. As such,
	it can be viewed as a method of carrying out COA with grouped data.
	RESULTS: We illustrate the power of the method using two cancer data
	sets. In both cases, we can quickly and accurately classify test
	samples from any number of specified a priori groups and identify
	the genes which characterize these groups. We obtained very high
	rates of correct classification, as determined by jack-knife or validation
	experiments with training and test sets. The results are comparable
	to those from other methods in terms of accuracy but the power and
	flexibility of BGA make it an especially attractive method for the
	analysis of microarray cancer data.},

	When compared with normal samples, the Crouzon's syndrome sample
	exhibits the following major characteristics: The mid-face is concave

  abstract = {A large-scale study of facial soft tissue depths of Caucasian adults
	was conducted. Over a 2-years period, 967 Caucasian subjects of both
	sexes, varying age and varying body mass index (BMI) were studied.
	A user-friendly and mobile ultrasound-based system was used to measure,
	in about 20 min per subject, the soft tissue thickness at 52 facial
	landmarks including most of the landmarks used in previous studies.
	This system was previously validated on repeatability and accuracy
	[S. De Greef, P. Claes, W. Mollemans, M. Loubele, D. Vandermeulen,
	P. Suetens, G. Willems, Semi-automated ultrasound facial soft tissue
	depth registration: method and validation. J. Forensic Sci. 50 (2005)].
	The data of 510 women and 457 men were analyzed in order to update
	facial soft tissue depth charts of the contemporary Caucasian adult.
	Tables with the average thickness values for each landmark as well
	as the standard deviation and range, tabulated according to gender,
	age and BMI are reported. In addition, for each landmark and for
	both sexes separately, a multiple linear regression of thickness
	versus age and BMI is calculated. The lateral asymmetry of the face
	was analysed on an initial subset of 588 subjects showing negligible
	differences and thus warranting the unilateral measurements of the
	remaining subjects. The new dataset was statistically compared to
	three datasets for the Caucasian adults: the traditional datasets
	of Rhine and Moore [J.S. Rhine, C.E. Moore, Tables of facial tissue
	thickness of American Caucasoids in forensic anthropology. Maxwell
	Museum Technical series 1 (1984)] and Helmer [R. Helmer, Schädelidentifizierung
	durch elektronische bildmischung, Kriminalistik Verlag GmbH, Heidelberg,
	1984] together with the most recent in vivo study by Manhein et al.
	[M.H. Manhein, G.A. Listi, R.E. Barsley, R. Musselman, N.E. Barrow,
	D.H. Ubelbaker, In vivo facial tissue depth measurements for children
	and adults. J. Forensic Sci. 45 (2000) 48-60]. The large-scale database
	presented in this paper offers a denser sampling of the facial soft
	tissue depths of a more representative subset of the actual Caucasian
	population over the different age and body posture subcategories.
	This database can be used as an updated chart for manual and computer-based
	craniofacial approximation and allows more refined analyses of the
	possible factors affecting facial soft tissue depth.},

  pages = {--},
  abstract = {Craniofacial reconstruction is important in forensic identification.
	It aims to estimate a facial appearance for human skeletal remains
	using the relationship between the soft tissue and the underlying
	bone structure. Various computerized methods have been developed
	in recent decades. An effective way is to deform a reference skull
	to the discovered skull, and then apply the same deformation to the
	skin associated with the reference skull to provide an approximate
	face for the discovered skull. For this method, the better the two
	skulls match each other, the more face-like the reconstructed skin
	surface will be. In this paper, we present a novel skull registration
	method that can match the two skulls closely, so as to improve the
	accuracy of the reconstruction. It combines both global and local
	deformations. A generic thin-plate spline (TPS)-based deformation,
	which is global, is applied first to roughly align the two skulls
	based on two groups of manually defined landmarks. Afterwards, the
	two skulls are largely matched, except some regions, on which some
	new landmarks are automatically marked. A compact support radial
	basis functions (CSRBF)-based deformation, which is local, will then
	be performed on these regions to adjust the initial alignment of
	the two skulls. Such adjustment can be repeatedly implemented until
	the two skulls have optimal alignment. In addition, all the skulls
	and face involved in the registration are represented by their single
	outer surfaces to facilitate the reconstruction procedure. The experiments
	demonstrate that our method can create a plausible face even when
	the reference skull is very different from the discovered skull.
	As a result, we can make full use of our database to provide multiple
	estimates for a principle components analysis (PCA) for the final
	reconstruction.},

	by a shift in this perception. From then, Neanderthals appear as
	essentially human creatures trapped in archaic bodies. Following
	this initial ideological oscillation the recent decades represent
	a parallel existence of both paradigms as well as a widening of conceptualizations.
	This paper argues that these ideological constructs remain operative,
	continuing to inform and form our perceptions of what Neanderthals
	are/are not.},

	the literature reveals a basic understanding of the aging process
	in the nose but a paucity of documentation and few organized studies.
	This study was designed to identify systematically the age-related
	changes in the normal, nondiseased adult nose. A nasal-sinus laboratory
	was created, and a computerized patient database was developed. Four
	separate investigations were conducted. First, 111 subjects ranging
	in age from 21 to 94 years of age were studied prospectively using
	135 variables. The following data were collected: history, symptoms,
	physical examination, rhinomanometry, ciliary beat frequency, smell
	testing, and incentive spirometry. Second, photographs of a separate
	group of 105 subjects 20 to 86 years of age were studied to ascertain
	the facial cephalometric changes that occur with aging. Third, a
	histopathologic examination of the nasal septum was performed in
	20 additional subjects to evaluate the cellular changes that accompany
	aging. Finally, an epidemiologic study analyzing the prevalence of
	various nasal complaints by age was conducted, based on a review
	of more than 11,000 patient charts from surgeries and office visits.
	A number of specific age-related changes in the nose were identified,
	including an increased likelihood of certain nasal complaints, a
	pattern of increasing airflow resistance, and a decrease in physical
	abnormalities in the nasopharynx. The appearance of the nose, as
	measured by the nasolabial angle and the height/length ratio, was
	also found to change with age. Laryngoscope, 106:(suppl 81):1-25,

	and of the mandibular bone as a whole, in response to external loading
	is discussed. A survey is given of the determinants of mandibular
	stiffness and strength, including the mechanical properties and distribution
	of bone tissue and the size and shape of the mandible. Mandibular
	deformations, stresses, and strains that occur during static biting
	and chewing are reviewed. During biting and the powerstroke of mastication,
	a combination of sagittal bending, corpus rotation, and transverse
	bending occurs. The result is a complex pattern of stresses and strains
	(compressive, tensile, shear, torsional) in the mandible. To be able
	to resist forces and bending and torsional moments, not only the
	material properties of the mandible but also its geometrical design
	is of importance. This is reflected by variables like polar and maximum
	and minimum moments of inertia and the relative amount and distribution
	of bone tissue. In the longitudinal direction, the mandible is stiffer
	than in transverse directions, and the vertical cross-sectional dimension
	of the mandible is larger than its transverse dimension. These features
	enhance the resistance of the mandible to the relatively large vertical
	shear forces and bending moments that come into play in the sagittal
	plane.},

	cell phone cameras, surveillance video systems, webcams, and traditional
	film and broadcast video. As a result, law enforcement and intelligence
	agencies have numerous opportunities to acquire and analyze images
	that depict persons of interest. Computer-Aided Forensic Facial Comparison
	is a comprehensive exploration of the scientific, technical, and
	statistical challenges facing researchers investigating courtroom
	identification from facial images.
	
	Supported by considerable background material, research data, and
	prototypic statistical and applications software, this volume brings
	together contributions from anthropologists, computer scientists,
	forensic scientists, and statisticians. Topics discussed include:
	
	 * Face database collection in 3D * Error and distinguishing power
	associated with craniofacial landmarks * Statistical analysis of
	face shape variation * Comparison of instrumentation * Court admissibility
	issues * Missing data * Computer applications development
	
	Based on the quantification and analysis of more than 3000 facial
	images, this seminal work lays the foundation for future forensic
	facial comparison, computer applications development, and research
	in face shape variation and analysis. Using experimental and real
	case data, it demonstrates the influence of illumination, image resolution,
	perspective, and pose angle on landmark visibility. Two DVDs are
	included which contain the raw 3D landmark datasets for 3000 faces,
	additional datasets used in 2D analysis, and computer programs and
	spreadsheets used in analysis and in the development of prototypic
	applications software.},

	widely dispersed and genetically very diverse groups of humans isolated
	for tens of thousands of years, or among very closely related groups
	spread over climatically different regions. Here we present a study
	of one East Asian and seven North Asian populations in which we examine
	the evidence for convergent adaptations of the mid-face to a very
	cold climate. Our findings indicate that mid-facial morphology is
	strongly associated with climatic variables that contrast the temperate
	climate of East Asians and the very cold and dry climate of North
	Asians. This is also the case when either maxillary or nasal cavity
	measurements are considered alone. The association remains significant
	when mtDNA distances among populations are taken into account. The
	morphological contrasts between populations are consistent with physiological
	predictions and prior studies of mid-facial cold adaptation in more
	temperate regions, but among North Asians there appear to be some
	previously undescribed morphological features that might be considered
	as adaptive to extreme cold. To investigate this further, analyses
	of the seven North Asian populations alone suggest that mid-facial
	morphology remains strongly associated with climate, particularly
	winter precipitation, contrasting coastal Arctic and continental
	climates. However, the residual covariation among North Asian mid-facial
	morphology and climate when genetic distances are considered, is
	not significant. These findings point to modern adaptations to extreme
	climate that might be relevant to our understanding of the mid-facial
	morphology of fossil hominins that lived during glaciations. Am J

  abstract = {Linear models are central to the practice of statistics and form the
	foundation of a vast range of statistical methodologies. Julian J.
	Faraway's critically acclaimed Linear Models with R examined regression
	and analysis of variance, demonstrated the different methods available,
	and showed in which situations each one applies. Following in those
	footsteps, Extending the Linear Model with R surveys the techniques
	that grow from the regression model, presenting three extensions
	to that framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect
	models, and nonparametric regression models. The author's treatment
	is thoroughly modern and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics,
	generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the use of neural
	networks in statistics. To demonstrate the interplay of theory and
	practice, throughout the book the author weaves the use of the R
	software environment to analyze the data of real examples, providing
	all of the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses. A supporting
	Web site at www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/ELM holds all of the
	data described in the book. Statisticians need to be familiar with
	a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book provides a well-stocked
	toolbox of methodologies, and with its unique presentation of these
	very modern statistical techniques, holds the potential to break
	new ground in the way graduate-level courses in this area are taught.},

  abstract = {Books on regression and the analysis of variance abound-many are introductory,
	many are theoretical. While most of them do serve a purpose, the
	fact remains that data analysis cannot be properly learned without
	actually doing it, and this means using a statistical software package.
	There are many of these to choose from as well, all with their particular
	strengths and weaknesses. Lately, however, one such package has begun
	to rise above the others thanks to its free availability, its versatility
	as a programming language, and its interactivity. That software is
	R. In the first book that directly uses R to teach data analysis,
	Linear Models with R focuses on the practice of regression and analysis
	of variance. It clearly demonstrates the different methods available
	and more importantly, in which situations each one applies. It covers
	all of the standard topics, from the basics of estimation to missing
	data, factorial designs, and block designs, but it also includes
	discussion on topics, such as model uncertainty, rarely addressed
	in books of this type. The presentation incorporates an abundance
	of examples that clarify both the use of each technique and the conclusions
	one can draw from the results. All of the data sets used in the book
	are available for download from http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/\~{}faraway/LMR/.
	The author assumes that readers know the essentials of statistical
	inference and have a basic knowledge of data analysis, linear algebra,
	and calculus. The treatment reflects his view of statistical theory
	and his belief that qualitative statistical concepts, while somewhat
	more difficult to learn, are just as important because they enable
	us to practice statistics rather than just talk about it.},

	coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the orbits and face
	were obtained by an electromagnetic digitizer in 40 male and 33 female
	adolescents aged 12 to 15 years, 73 female and 89 male young adults
	aged 19 to 30 years, and 41 male and 38 female adults aged 31 to

	height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal
	(head in natural head position) and Frankfurt plane; length and inclination
	of the eye fissure; and the orbital height to eye fissure length
	ratio were calculated and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were
	performed by factorial analysis of variance. Both the linear dimensions
	and the angular values were significantly larger in male subjects
	than in female subjects of corresponding age (p < 0.05). A significant
	effect of age was found (p < 0.05): while the linear distances and
	the orbital height-to-length ratio were greater in older people of
	the same sex, the inclination of the eye fissure decreased as a function
	of age. Both orbital inclinations were larger in the young adult
	group than in the adolescent and middle-aged groups. On average,
	the paired measurements were symmetrical, with similar values within
	each sex and age group. Data collected in this investigation could
	serve as a database for the quantitative description of human orbital
	morphology during normal adolescent and adult growth},

	that verifies the identity of a user based on image of their face.
	Accuracy of the authentication is reduced when the pose, illumination
	and expression of the training face images is different than the
	testing image. The methods in this paper are designed to improve
	the accuracy of a features-based face recognition system when the
	pose between the input image and training images are different. First,
	an efficient 2D-to-3D integrated face reconstruction approach is
	introduced to reconstruct a personalized 3D face model from a single
	frontal face image with neutral expression and normal illumination;
	Then, realistic virtual faces with different of pose are synthesized
	based on the personalized 3D face to characterize the face subspace;
	Finally, face recognition is conducted based on these representative
	virtual faces. Compared with other related works, this framework
	has the following advantages: 1) only one single frontal face is
	required for face recognition, which avoids the burdensome enrollment
	work; and, 2) the synthesized face samples provide the capability
	to conduct recognition under difficult conditions like complex pose,
	illumination and expression. From the experimental results show that
	the propose method improve the accuracy of face recognition with
	variant pose, illumination and expression.},

	(Minolta Vivid 900), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), 3D stereo-photogrammetry
	(Di3D system) and to compare them to physical linear measurements.
	The study sample consisted of seven cadaver heads. The reliability
	and accuracy were assessed by means of a series of 21 standardized,
	linear facial measurements derived from 15 landmarks taken both directly
	on the face with a set of digital callipers and indirectly from a
	three-dimensional (3D) soft tissue surface models derived from CBCT,
	laser surface scans and 3D photographs. Statistical analysis for
	the reliability was done by means of intraclass correlation coefficients
	(ICCs). Accuracy was determined by means of the absolute error (AE)
	and absolute percentage error (APE) by comparison of the 3D measurements
	to the physical anthropometrical measurements. All the 3D scanning
	systems were proved to be very reliable (ICC0.923-0.999) when compared
	to the physical measurements (ICC; 0.964-0.999). Only one CBCT measurement
	(t-g) and one Di3D measurement (t-sn left) had a mean AE of more
	than 1.5mm. There are clear potential benefits of using 3D measurements
	appose to direct measurements in the assessment of facial deformities.
	Measurements recorded by the three 3D systems appeared to be both
	sufficiently accurate and reliable enough for research and clinical
	use.},

  abstract = {The analysis of mandibular growth changes around the pubertal spurt
	in humans has several important implications for the diagnosis and
	orthopedic correction of skeletal disharmonies. The purpose of this
	study was to evaluate mandibular shape and size growth changes around
	the pubertal spurt in a longitudinal sample of subjects with normal
	occlusion by means of an appropriate morphometric technique (thin-plate
	spline analysis). Ten mandibular landmarks were identified on lateral
	cephalograms of 29 subjects at 6 different developmental phases.
	The 6 phases corresponded to 6 different maturational stages in cervical
	vertebrae during accelerative and decelerative phases of the pubertal
	growth curve of the mandible. Differences in shape between average
	mandibular configurations at the 6 developmental stages were visualized
	by means of thin-plate spline analysis and subjected to permutation
	test. Centroid size was used as the measure of the geometric size
	of each mandibular specimen. Differences in size at the 6 developmental
	phases were tested statistically. The results of graphical analysis
	indicated a statistically significant change in mandibular shape
	only for the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical
	vertebral maturation. Significant increases in centroid size were
	found at all developmental phases, with evidence of a prepubertal
	minimum and of a pubertal maximum. The existence of a pubertal peak
	in human mandibular growth, therefore, is confirmed by thin-plate
	spline analysis. Significant morphological changes in the mandible
	during the growth interval from stage 3 to stage 4 in cervical vertebral
	maturation may be described as an upward-forward direction of condylar
	growth determining an overall "shrinkage" of the mandibular configuration
	along the measurement of total mandibular length. This biological
	mechanism is particularly efficient in compensating for major increments
	in mandibular size at the adolescent spurt.}

  year = {1991},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {It has been suggested that the long-standing association of variability
	in the human nasal index [100 × (nasal breadth)/(nasal height)] with
	climatic variation is spurious evidence for natural selection in
	humans (Hoyme, 1965; St. Hoyme and Iscan, 1989). The argument is
	based principally on the observation that nasal height is globally
	more variable than nasal breadth, with nasal breadth thus contributing
	little to variation in the index. This argument does not take into
	account the confounding effect of absolute size of these variables
	on their variances. In this study we compare the intrinsic variation
	in skeletal nasal height and breadth within and among 26 mixed-sex
	populations (N = 2,408) at globally diverse localities (Howells,
	1989), using 2 × 2 variance-covariance matrices of the logarithmically
	transformed variates. Hypothesis tests for homogeneity of matrices
	and equalvariance/equal-covariance indicate that the intrinsic variation
	in nasal breadth is greater than that for nasal height within populations,
	and that nasal breadth and nasal height exhibit equivalent intrinsic
	variation among populations. The argument that nasal breadth contributes
	little to the worldwide variation in the human nasal index is rejected.
	Given our present understanding of nasal physiological morpho-function,
	these results support, but do not demonstrate, an adaptive role for
	human nasal index variation. Promising methods for elucidating natural
	selection on human nasal form are suggested.},

	and forensic anthropology. Recent literature demonstrates that new
	methods are constantly being developed, concurrent with refinements
	to those already commonly employed. The present study concerns the
	application of geometric morphometrics to assess the potential of
	mandibular morphology as a developmental marker for estimating age
	at death in subadult human skeletal remains. The sample comprises
	79 known age and sex subadult individuals of South African Bantu
	and African American origin; 38 bilateral three-dimensional landmarks
	were designed and acquired using a portable digitizer. Linear regression
	was used to predict age using the multivariate descriptors of mandible
	size and shape based on configurations of three-dimensional landmarks.
	Our results show that the mandible can be used to predict age in
	the subadult skeleton with accuracy comparable to standards based
	on the dentition (standard error rates are between ±1.3 and ±3.0 years).
	These results closely parallel our previous study using the linear
	measurement of ramus height, but suggest that geometric morphometrics
	may be slightly more accurate when adolescents are included in the
	sample.},

	of the transformed linear data were made with those in a traditional

	univariate comparisons demonstrated that accurate linear measurements
	could be derived from three-dimensional data, showing that it is
	possible to simultaneously obtain data for three-dimensional geometric
	'shape' and linear inter-landmark analyses. Using Penrose and canonical
	variates analyses of the transformed three-dimensional inter-landmark
	measurements, similar population distances were found for the four
	indigenous southern African populations. The inter-population distance
	relationships took the form of three separated pairs of distances,
	with the within-pair distances very similar in size. The cranial
	features of the four populations were found to be overall very similar
	morphometrically. However the populations were each shown by CVA
	to have population specific features, and using discriminant analyses
	50% or more of the individual crania (with the exception of the Sotho)

	Nine linear measurements, obtained from mathematically transformed

	Kohn et al. [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 90:147-158). It can be
	argued that diverging observations partly result from methodological
	constraints. The present study compares samples of intentionally
	deformed and undeformed human crania, using elliptic Fourier analysis
	(EFA), a morphometric approach which has been shown to be particularly
	appropriate for characterizing the shape of two-dimensional outlines
	and associated shape changes. We improve the standard EFA approach
	by adding a preliminary orientation of the outlines following the
	rotation parameters of a Procrustes superimposition, using multiple
	homologous landmarks called control points. The results confirm that
	circumferentially deformed skulls exhibit modifications of the basioccipital
	region, together with increased anterior and inferior facial projection.
	However, the degree to which basioccipital flattening is modified
	in circumferentially deformed Peruvians was found to be less marked
	than changes observed in the face. Some of the modifications observed
	here can be related to morphological trends existing in the population
	from which our sample was taken. The observation of other modifications
	may be subject to methodological constraints of standard morphometric

  pages = {n/a--n/a},
  abstract = {Qualitative methods of describing sexual dimorphism in discrete cranial
	traits have been criticized for their subjectivity and statistical
	limitations. However, researchers have yet to be able to accurately
	capture the morphology of these individual traits using traditional
	metric techniques. This article presents a method to quantify morphological
	variation in the skeletal browridge and chin using 3D surface laser
	scans. Browridge and chin regions are isolated from the skull using
	objectively defined landmarks and planes. Region areas and volumes
	are used to quantify absolute and relative size, while semilandmarks
	along transects are used for more detailed morphometric analyses.
	An intraobserver error study indicates high repeatability of the
	method. Application of the method is demonstrated on a sample of
	US males and females of black and white ancestries. Results suggest
	significant effects of both sex and ancestry on brow and chin morphologies
	and are consistent with traditional qualitative descriptions. Our
	results indicate that the method can accurately and reliably quantify
	browridge and chin morphologies, providing a tool to objectively
	describe and statistically analyze these traditionally qualitative

	trans- fer, shape-space analysis and exploration, and the automatic
	generation of realistic distributions of objects. We present a method
	for matching a template to a collection of possibly target meshes.
	Our method uses a very small number of user-placed landmarks, which
	we augment with automatically detected feature correspondences, found
	using spin images. We deform the template onto the data using an
	ICP-like framework, smoothing the noisy correspondences at each step
	so as to produce an averaged motion. The deformation uses a dierential
	representation of the mesh, with which the deformation can be computed
	at each iteration by solving a sparse linear system. We have applied
	our algorithm to a variety of data sets. Using only 11 landmarks
	between a template and one of the scans from the CEASAR data set,
	we are able to deform the template, and correctly identify and transfer
	distinctive features, which are not identied by user-supplied landmarks.
	We have also successfully established correspondences between several
	scans of monkey skulls, which have dangling triangles, non-manifold
	vertices, and self intersections. Our algorithm does not require
	a clean target mesh, and can even generate correspondence without
	trimming our extraneous pieces from the target mesh, such as scans
	of teeth.},

	the maxillary dental arch has been examined within samples of Negro

	nasal height and the length of the cranial base and between nasal
	breadth and the distance which separates the upper canine teeth.
	Regression analysis has yielded quantitative estimates of the effect
	on a given dimension of variation in one or more of the others. It
	seems probable that both nasal shape and the maxillary dental arch-prognathism
	complex may be subject to direct selection by environmental stress.
	The morphological association between these complexes suggests that
	a part of the interpopulation variation in prognathism may be a secondary
	effect of selection acting on the nose. Similarly, selection acting
	on the dental arch or maxilla could produce secondary changes in
	the nasal index (i.e. a non-adaptive component of nasal variation).},

	Both molars exhibit a strong reduction of the distal cusps in recent

	proportions in the three groups. Second molars tend to show four
	well developed cusps in earlier hominin species and their morphology
	is only marginally affected by allometric effects. Third molars can
	be incipiently reduced in earlier species and they evince a significant

	European Middle Pleistocene fossils from Sima de los Huesos (SH)
	show a very strong reduction of these two molars, even more marked
	than the reduction observed in Neanderthals and in modern human populations.
	The highly derived shape of SH molars points to an early acquisition

	to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation.
	The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly
	selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the
	Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on
	coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic
	regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant
	analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering
	of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify
	individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy
	of 90.9\% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape
	variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with
	shape variables were 93.4\% and 90.1\% for discriminant and k-means,
	respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males,
	especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical
	analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages
	of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape
	variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and
	multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape
	differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate
	between females and males.},

	patterning the shape differentiation among populations. This study
	evaluates the influence of size variation on craniofacial shape disparity
	among human populations from South America and assesses whether the
	morphological disparity observed at the interpopulation level resulted
	from a variable extension of the same ontogenetic allometry, or whether
	it arose as a result of divergences in the pattern of size-related
	shape changes. The size and shape of 282 adult and subadult crania
	were described by geometric morphometric-based techniques. Multivariate
	regressions were used to evaluate the influence of size on shape
	differentiation between and within populations, and phylogenetic
	comparative methods were used to take into account the shared evolutionary
	history among populations. The phylogenetic generalized least-squares
	models showed that size accounts for a significant amount of shape
	variation among populations for the vault and face but not for the
	base, suggesting that the three modules did not exhibit a uniform
	response to changes in overall growth. The common slope test indicated
	that patterns of evolutionary and ontogenetic allometry for the vault
	and face were similar and characterized by a heightening of the face
	and a lengthening of the vault with increasing size. The conservation
	of the same pattern of shape changes with size suggests that differences
	in the extent of growth contributed to the interpopulation cranial
	shape variation and that certain directions of morphological change
	were favored by the trait covariation along ontogeny. Anat Rec, 2011.

	assigned distance value indicates whether or not the point is within
	some object (positive) or outside of all objects (negative). Over
	the years, many different algorithms have been proposed to calculate
	the distance transform of an image. These algorithms often trade
	accuracy for efficiency, exhibit varying degrees of conceptual complexity,
	and some require parallel processors. One algorithm in particular,
	the Chamfer distance [J. ACM 15 (1968) 600, Comput. Vis. Graph. Image
	Process. 34 (1986) 344], has been analyzed for accuracy, is relatively
	efficient, requires no special computing hardware, and is conceptually
	straightforward. It is understandably, therefore, quite popular and
	widely used. We present a straightforward modification to the Chamfer
	distance transform algorithm that allows it to produce more accurate
	results without increasing the window size. We call this new algorithm
	Dead Reckoning as it is loosely based on the concept of continual
	measurements and course correction that was employed by ocean going
	vessel navigation in the past. We compare Dead Reckoning with a wide
	variety of other distance transform algorithms based on the Chamfer
	distance algorithm for both accuracy and speed, and demonstrate that
	Dead Reckoning produces more accurate results with comparable efficiency.},

  year = {2010},
  pages = {n/a--n/a},
  abstract = {Abstract The modern human mandibular symphysis differs from those
	of all other primates in being vertically orientated and possessing
	a chin, but the functional significance of this unique morphology
	is not well understood. Some hypotheses propose that it is an adaptation
	to specific loads occurring during masticatory function. This study
	uses finite element analysis to examine these symphyseal loads in
	a model of a modern human mandible. By modifying the symphyseal cross-sectional
	form, the mechanical significance of the presence of the chin and
	symphyseal orientation is tested, and modern human and Neanderthal
	symphyseal cross-sections are compared with regard to their ability
	to withstand different loads. The results show that changes in symphyseal
	form have profound effects on the strains. The presence of a chin
	leads to lower symphyseal strains overall, whereas a vertical orientation
	of the symphysis results in higher strains under wishboning, but
	not under vertical bending in the coronal plane and dorsoventral
	shear. Compared to Neanderthals, the modern human symphysis shows
	higher strains during dorsoventral shear and wishboning, but is as
	effective as the Neanderthal symphysis in resisting vertical bending
	in the coronal plane and the loads resulting from simulated incision
	and unilateral molar biting. In general, the results of this study
	corroborate prior hypotheses about the mechanical effects of the
	human chin and vertical symphyseal orientation and support the idea
	that the relative importance of wishboning and vertical bending in
	the coronal plane might have played a role in the evolution of modern
	human symphyseal morphology. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss,

  abstract = {The thin plate splines (TPS) has been applied to landmark-based elastic
	image registration. However, TPS forces the corresponding landmarks
	to exactly match each other, which is problematic when the localization
	of landmarks is prone to some error. Approximating TPS (ATPS) has
	been proposed to weak the interpolation condition. In ATPS, the regularization
	parameter plays an important role. It controls the smoothness of
	the transformation. Unfortunately, how to estimate is not solved.
	In this paper, estimation of the optimal regularization parameter
	has been proposed. It combines two evaluation factors, smoothness
	and location error hypothesis testing, to evaluate transformation
	results using fuzzy integral. The optimal regularization parameter
	is the best value maximizing the evaluation function. Experiments
	of the artificial grids and medial images show that our technique
	is feasible.},

	Data Bank (FDB) and computing discriminant function analyses (DFAs).
	Although widely used, this tool has been recently criticised, principally

	osteological collections and used to assess the reliability of sex
	determination using Fordisc® 3.0 with 12 cranial measurements. Comparisons
	were made using the whole FDB as well as using select groups, taking
	into account the posterior and typicality probabilities. The results
	of Fordisc® 3.0 vary between 52.2% and 77.8% depending on the options
	and groups selected. Tests of published discriminant functions and
	the computation of specific DFA were performed in order to discuss
	the applicability of this software and, overall, to question the
	pertinence of the use of DFA and linear distances in sex determination,
	in light of the huge cranial morphological variability.},

  abstract = {Fourier outline shape analysis is a powerful tool for the morphometric
	study of two-dimensional form in organisms lacking many biologically
	homologous landmarks. Several improvements to the method are described
	herein; these modifications are incorporated into the new computer
	programs Hangle, Hmatch and Hcurve. First, automated tracing of outlines
	using image capture software, although desirable, results in high
	frequency pixel 'noise' that can corrupt the Fourier analysis. Program
	Hangle eliminates this noise using optional and variable levels of
	outline smoothing. Secondly, a widely used Fourier technique, elliptic
	Fourier analysis (EFA, Kuhl and Giardina 1982), yields coefficients
	that are not computationally independent of each other, a condition
	that hampers and compromises statistical analysis. In addition, EFA
	increasingly downweights successively more detailed features of the
	outline. Program Hangle solves both of these problems. Lastly, Fourier
	methods in general are sensitive to the placement of the starting
	position of the digitized trace. This problem is acute when the organisms
	under study have no unambiguously defined, homologous point on the
	outline from which to start the trace. Program Hangle allows the
	user to normalize for starting position using various properties
	of individual outlines. Alternatively, Hmatch takes a new approach
	and can be used to normalize using properties of the entire population
	under study.key words: Fourier shape analysis, morphometric studies,

	an orthodontic sample. A total of 150 pretreatment cephalograms of
	consecutive patients (84 female, 66 male) were traced and digitized.
	Fifteen points were used for the analysis. The tracings were superimposed
	by the Procrustes method, and shape variability was assessed by principal
	component analysis. Approximately 70% of the total sample variability
	was incorporated in the first 5 principal components. The most significant
	principal component, accounting for 29% of shape variability, was
	the divergence of skeletal pattern; the second principal component,
	accounting for 20% of shape variability, was the anteroposterior
	maxillary relationship. It is recommended that Procrustes superimposition
	and principal component analysis be incorporated into routine cephalometric
	analysis for more valid and comprehensive shape assessment.}

	of Japan, are one of the key groups in the population history of
	East Asia, because they retain many archaic characters that may be
	traced back to Eurasian Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. In this
	study, the regional diversity of the Jomon skeletal series was estimated
	by applying the R-matrix method to 34 craniofacial measurements.
	The patterns of intraregional variation indicate little effect on
	the genetic structure of the Jomon from long-term gene flow stemming
	from an outside source. The regional diversities were further estimated
	by pooling all individuals into regional aggregates, and by computing
	the mean variance within local groups in each region. Although the
	pattern of phenotypic variation differs depending on the unit of
	analysis, the gradient of the diversity retains its identity. The
	Hokkaido region, the northernmost part of the Japanese archipelago,
	has the highest variance, followed by the regions of eastern Japan,
	while the southwestern regions have the lowest variance. These findings
	suggest that the Jomon ancestors of the northern part of Japan might
	have expanded southward to Honshu Island. Global analyses including
	samples from Eurasia, Africa, and Australia dating roughly to the
	same chronological periods as those of the Jomon samples, indicate
	that the Jomon cranial series share part of their ancestral gene
	pool with early northeastern Asians. The present findings support
	the archeologically suggested population growth and expansion in
	the northern half of the Eurasian continent during the late Pleistocene
	and early Holocene periods. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2009. © 2008 Wiley-Liss,

	apply these techniques to evaluate proposed cranio-facial 'incipient'
	facial, vault, and basicranial traits in a middle-late Pleistocene
	European hominin sample when compared to a sample of the same time
	depth from Africa. Some of the features examined followed the predictions
	of the accretion model and relate the middle Pleistocene European
	material to the later Neanderthals. However, although our analysis
	showed a clear separation between Neanderthals and early/recent modern
	humans and morphological proximity between European specimens from
	OIS 7 to 3, it also shows that the European hominins from the first

  abstract = {Cranial morphology is widely used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships,
	but its reliability in reflecting phylogeny and population history
	has been questioned. Some cranial regions, particularly the face
	and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment
	and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are
	thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct
	testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of
	large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations
	have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly
	due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations
	used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics
	methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and
	relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population
	history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human
	populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively
	reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and
	relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These
	distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances
	among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate
	that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances,
	while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association
	with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial
	regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because
	different cranial regions preserve population history and climate
	signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial
	anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. Anat Rec Part A, 2006. ©

	the angular measurements were taken by photogrammetric method. Eight
	nasal proportion indices were calculated according to the linear
	measurements. The application of the independent-samples t-test showed
	sex dimorphism in most parameters of the nasal region. All the linear
	measurements were larger in men than in women, whereas all the angular
	measurements were smaller in men than in women. The significant differences
	in partial parameters between men and women have been proved. Ten
	of 12 linear measurements, 1 of 3 angular measurements, and 3 of
	8 nasal proportion indices showed significant sexual dimorphism (P
	< 0.01). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, the nasal anthropometric
	measurements and proportion indices of Han Chinese adults were different,

	can be classified using protocols for manually segmenting and labeling
	structures. For large cohorts, time and expertise requirements make
	this approach impractical. To achieve automation, an individual segmentation
	can be propagated to another individual using an anatomical correspondence
	estimate relating the atlas image to the target image. The accuracy
	of the resulting target labeling has been limited but can potentially
	be improved by combining multiple segmentations using decision fusion.
	We studied segmentation propagation and decision fusion on 30 normal
	brain MR images, which had been manually segmented into 67 structures.
	Correspondence estimates were established by nonrigid registration
	using free-form deformations. Both direct label propagation and an
	indirect approach were tested. Individual propagations showed an
	average similarity index (SI) of 0.754&#xa0;Â±&#xa0;0.016 against
	manual segmentations. Decision fusion using 29 input segmentations
	increased SI to 0.836&#xa0;Â±&#xa0;0.009. For indirect propagation
	of a single source via 27 intermediate images, SI was 0.779&#xa0;Â±&#xa0;0.013.
	We also studied the effect of the decision fusion procedure using
	a numerical simulation with synthetic input data. The results helped
	to formulate a model that predicts the quality improvement of fused
	brain segmentations based on the number of individual propagated
	segmentations combined. We demonstrate a practicable procedure that
	exceeds the accuracy of previous automatic methods and can compete

	for extracting biologically meaningful shape covariance from digitized
	samples, making statistical comparisons between groups and visualizing

	the third, biological, challenge is to demonstrate a relationship

  volume = {2},
  number = {0},
  abstract = {Not all detectable differences between face images correspond to a
	change in identity. Here we measure both sensitivity to change and
	the criterion difference that is perceived as a change in identity.
	Both measures are used to test between possible similarity metrics.
	Using a same/different task and the method of constant stimuli criterion
	is specified as the 50% ?different? point (P50) and sensitivity as
	the Difference Limen (DL). Stimuli and differences are defined within
	a ?face-space? based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of measured
	differences in three-dimensional shape. In Experiment 1 we varied
	views available. Criterion (P50) was lowest for identical full-face
	view comparisons that can be based on image differences. When comparing
	across views P50, was the same for a static 45&#186; change as for
	multiple animated views, although sensitivity (DL) was higher for
	the animated case, where it was as high as for identical views. Experiments
	2 and 3 tested possible similarity metrics. Experiment 2 contrasted
	Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance by setting PC1 or PC2 to zero.
	DL did not differ between conditions consistent with Mahalanobis.
	P50 was lower when PC2 changed emphasising that perceived changes
	in identity are not determined by the magnitude of Euclidean physical
	differences. Experiment 3 contrasted a distance with an angle based
	similarity measure. We varied the distinctiveness of the faces being
	compared by varying distance from the origin, a manipulation that
	affects distances but not angles between faces. Angular P50 and DL
	were both constant for faces from 1 to 2 standard deviations from
	the mean, consistent with an angular measure. We conclude that both
	criterion and sensitivity need to be considered and that an angular
	similarity metric based on standardised PC values provides the best
	metric for specifying what physical differences will be perceived
	to change in identity.},

	patient presented with a displaced left orbital roof fracture into
	his orbit causing globe compression and binocular vertical diplopia.
	A second patient underwent removal of his right orbital floor, medial
	wall, and inferior portion of his lateral wall during excision of
	a cylindrical cell papilloma of the paranasal sinuses. Postoperatively,
	he suffered from globe ptosis and binocular oblique diplopia, Intervention:
	Stereolithographic models of the patients' orbits were obtained from
	computed tomography data to better assess the bony orbital pathology.
	In the second patient, the model was used as a template to create
	a temporary custom fit prosthesis to repair the defect of his orbital
	walls. Results: The SLA models were useful in evaluating the dimensions
	of the bony defects and in preoperative surgical planning. Intraoperatively,
	the SLA models facilitated orbital surgical rehabilitation. Postoperatively,
	both patients noted resolution of their diplopia after reconstruction
	of more normal bony anatomy. Conclusions: In selected cases, SLA
	offers highly accurate models of the bony orbit for preoperative
	evaluation, surgical planning, and teaching and can act as a template
	for custom prosthesis manufacturing, This technology increases the
	orbital surgeon's options in managing complex orbital pathology.},

  abstract = {As a component of the chondrocranium, the nasal septum influences
	the anteroposterior dimensions of the facial skeleton. The role of
	the septum as a facial growth center, however, has been studied primarily
	in long-snouted mammals, and its precise influence on human facial
	growth is not as well understood. Whereas the nasal septum may be
	important in the anterior growth of the human facial skeleton early
	in ontogeny, the high incidence of nasal septal deviation in humans
	suggests the septums influence on human facial length is limited
	to the early phases of facial growth. Nevertheless, the nasal septum
	follows a growth trajectory similar to the facial skeleton and, as
	such, its prolonged period of growth may influence other aspects
	of facial development. Using computed tomography scans of living
	human subjects (n = 70), the goal of the present study is to assess
	the morphological relationship between the nasal septum and facial
	skeleton in European- and African-derived populations, which have
	been shown to exhibit early developmental differences in the nasal
	septal premaxillary complex. First we assessed whether there is population
	variation in the size of the nasal septum in European- and African-derived
	samples. This included an evaluation of septal deviation and the
	spatial constraints that influence variation in this condition. Next,
	we assessed the relationship between nasal septal size and craniofacial
	shape using multivariate regression techniques. Our results indicate
	that there is significant population variation in septal size and
	magnitude of septal deviation, both of which are greater in the European-derived
	sample. While septal deviation suggests a disjunction between the
	nasal septum and other components of the facial skeleton, we nevertheless
	found a significant relationship between the size of the nasal septum
	and craniofacial shape, which appears to largely be a response to
	the need to accommodate variation in nasal septal size.},

	history, and the degree to which it might be influenced by environmental
	factors and selection pressures have been widely discussed. Recent
	consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population
	history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements
	being more informative on population history, while others being
	under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest
	and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens
	from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard
	craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D2 for
	three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset;
	and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance
	matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as
	well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated
	Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results
	to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings
	support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial
	morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of
	the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic
	factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely
	restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including
	Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of
	these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through

	One of the goals of anthropological research is to investigate biological
	human variation of past and present populations. Of particular interest
	is the study of sexual dimorphism, which can shed light on the human
	condition and aid in the identification of unidentified remains.
	When dealing with human skeletal remains, one of the four pillars
	of the anthropological protocol is the estimation of sex. Problems
	arise when applying sexing methods to different populations. Consequently,
	a skeletally robust female may appear to be "male", particularly
	in light of cross-population comparisons. The purpose of this study
	is to evaluate sexual dimorphism of the craniofacial complex in two
	local Portuguese samples (Coimbra, F= 40, M=39; Lisbon, F=27, M=28).
	An index of sexual dimorphism or ISD was used to assess the level
	of sexual dimorphism within each sample (Lisbon ISD=3.71; Coimbra
	ISD=3.07). The Student's t-test indicates that the degree of sexual
	dimorphism is not significantly different between Coimbra and Lisbon
	(P=0.31). However, Mahalanobis distance, which was computed to examine
	differences among the groups, indicates that Lisbon females differ
	significantly from the other samples and the pattern of sexual dimorphism
	coincides with the ISD results. The disparity of the Lisbon females
	may indicate the possible influence of immigration or genetic diversity
	left behind by the numerous population influxes on the Iberian Peninsula
	and warrants further study.},

	there is population specific anatomic variation resulting from genetics
	and environment. The purpose of this paper is to assess Romanian
	sexual dimorphism by discriminant function analysis and to compare
	the results with those of other Caucasians. The sample is composed
	of 50 males and 50 females specimens, with known age and sex, belonging
	to the Francisc; Ramer collection (Bucharest). The individuals of
	the collection died during 1920 to 1940 in hospitals to where they
	came from many regions of the country, especially from unprivileged
	sociocultural milieu. The mean age is 35.57 years for males and 33.20
	for females (statistically not significant). A total of seven mandibular
	dimensions are taken according to the Martin procedure by the senior
	author. Data are analyzed initially through direct method of discriminant
	analysis statistic (SPSS). This has provided 86.7% accuracy. When
	the same dimensions are analyzed with the stepwise procedure, five
	of them (height of ascending ramus, bigonial breadth, mandibular
	length, mandibular symphysis height, minimum breadth of ascending
	ramus) are selected. Classification accuracy has remained the same
	(86.7%). This suggests that sexual dimorphism is also well pronounced
	in the country with an accuracy rate as high as other Caucasoid population,
	such as South African and American whites.},

	this study came from the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria.
	The sample is composed of 53 white males and 53 white females and
	45 black males and 45 black females. Using 13 standard cranial and
	4 mandibular dimensions, average accuracies of 98% were obtained
	from the crania, which were much more discriminatory than the mandibles
	(74% males, 87% females). When a "leave-one-out classification" technique
	was applied to the sample to measure accuracy of multivariate classification,
	this accuracy was about the same as obtained from the multivariate
	function. A posterior probability of 0.80 or more was found in as
	much as 96% of the sample, Stepwise discriminant function formulae
	for incomplete remains (vault and face) were also derived. Prediction
	accuracy was considerably lower when North American based formulae
	were tested on the South Africans, indicating significant craniometric
	differences between these populations.}

  abstract = {Abstract The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique serves
	as a practical tool in diagnosis, surgical planning, and outcome
	prediction of plastic and reconstructive surgery. In our study, the
	morphologic features of the Chinese adult orbit were described by
	11 anatomic parameters using a 3D reconstruction technique. Sixty-four
	Chinese adults were selected randomly from patients who had undergone
	craniofacial computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose conditions
	other than craniofacial or orbital deformations. The morphologic
	parameters of orbit such as bony orbital volume, orbital foramen
	area and orbital rim perimeter were measured on 3D models using this
	technique. Differences between the two orbits and between the two
	sexes were investigated. The method of measurement showed high reproducibility
	of results. No difference between the two orbits was found. There
	were significant differences between men and women in all anatomic
	parameters other than orbital height. In men and women, respectively,
	mean bony orbital volume was 26.02 and 23.32 mL, mean orbital foramen
	area 11.80 and 11.10 cm2, mean orbital rim perimeter 12.65 and 12.20 cm,
	mean orbital height 33.35 and 33.22 mm, mean orbital width 40.02
	and 38.00 mm; mean orbital floor length 47.93 and 46.18 mm, mean
	orbital roof length 52.93 and 50.89 mm, mean medial orbital wall
	length 46.43 and 44.41 mm, mean lateral orbital wall length 48.38
	and 46.91 mm, mean intraorbital distance 27.18 and 25.11 mm, mean
	extra-orbital distance 98.77 and 93.69 mm. It is concluded that the
	measurements of these orbital parameters could be obtained from a
	3D reconstruction method. The two orbits were symmetric based on
	orbital volume and other anatomic parameters. Orbital size was significantly
	smaller in women than in men; orbital height, however, was similar.
	The findings of the present study allow for quantification of the
	orbital features of Chinese adults and provide parameters for preoperative
	planning and prediction of postoperative outcome.},

	Sixty-two orbits obtained from 31 skulls of male adult Caucasians
	were measured with a millimetric compass. On the medial orbital wall,
	the midpoint of the anterior lacrimal crest was the reference point;
	from this point we measured distances of 23.9 +/- 3.3 mm, 35.6 +/-
	2.3 mm, 41.7 +/- 3.1 mm and 6.9 +/- 1.5 mm respectively to the anterior
	ethmoidal foramen, posterior ethmoidal foramen, midpoint of the medial
	aspect of the optic canal and posterior lacrimal crest. On the same
	wall, distances from the plane of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal
	foramina to the ethmoido-maxillary suture and distance from the posterior
	ethmoidal foramen to the anterior ethmoidal foramen and midpoint
	of the medial margin of the optic canal were 14.9 +/- 2.3 mm, 9.8
	+/- 2.9 mm and 6.8 +/- 2.2 mm respectively. On the inferior orbital
	wall, the main reference point was the infraorbital foramen, and
	from this point to the midpoints of the lateral margin of the fossa
	for the lacrimal gland, inferior orbital fissure, inferior orbital
	rim and inferior aspect of the optic canal was 23.8 +/- 7.2 mm, 31.9
	+/- 3.9 mm, 6.7 +/- 1.9 mm and 50.3 +/- 3.2 mm respectively. On the
	superior orbital wall, the distances from the supraorbital foramen
	to the midpoints of the superior orbital fissure, fossa for the lacrimal
	gland and superior aspect of the optic canal were 45.7 +/- 3.6 mm,
	26.0 +/- 2.5 mm and 45.3 +/- 3.2 mm respectively. Furthermore, on
	the same wall, the distance from the posterior ethmoidal foramen
	to the midpoint of the superior orbital fissure was 14.6 +/- 2.8
	mm. Finally, on the lateral orbital wall the frontozygomatic suture
	was the reference point. From this point distances to the midpoints
	of the fossa for the lacrimal gland, superior orbital fissure, lateral
	aspect of the optic canal and inferior orbital fissure were 17.5

  abstract = {There will always be criminal cases, where the evidence DNA sample
	will not match either a suspect's DNA profile, or any in a criminal
	DNA database. In the absence of DNA-based mass intelligence screenings,
	including familial searching (both of which may be restricted by
	legislation), there is only one option to potentially avoid or retrospectively
	solve "cold cases": the DNA-based prediction of human externally
	visible characteristics of an unknown person based on the crime scene
	sample left behind. Predictive DNA markers are expected to be available
	for some group-specific appearance traits in the near future; although
	it is unlikely that we will soon be able to understand the biological
	complexity of individual-specific appearance. In suspect-less cases
	reliable DNA-based prediction of broader externally visible characteristics
	from crime scene samples are expected to reduce the potential pool
	of suspects by allowing police investigations to concentrate on specific
	groups of people. Here, we aim to describe the forensic motivations
	for DNA-based prediction of human externally visible traits as well
	as the scientific challenges of finding predictive DNA markers, and
	will discuss examples with promising (e.g. sex, eye color and hair
	color), as well as less promising expectations (e.g. adult body height),
	in the foreseen future. Despite the complex ethical and legal implications
	arising from DNA-based prediction of externally visible characteristics,
	we argue that their use does not lead to a violation of privacy.
	We suggest that likelihood-based results, rather than DNA data itself,
	should be provided to the police for investigative purposes avoiding
	data protection issues. Furthermore, we note that the risk of exacerbating
	social pressure on minority groups due to DNA-based prediction of
	externally visible traits in crime cases may be reduced rather than
	increased compared to a conventional eyewitness testimony. A firm
	legal basis will need to be established for the application of these
	promising qualitative techniques. To gain the attention of legislative
	bodies, we invite the forensic community to participate in a public
	discourse of these issues.},

  abstract = {Intentional cranial deformations (ICD) have been observed worldwide
	but are especially prevalent in preColombian cultures. The purpose
	of this study was to assess the consequences of ICD on three cranial
	cavities (intracranial cavity, orbits, and maxillary sinuses) and
	on cranial vault thickness, in order to screen for morphological
	changes due to the external constraints exerted by the deformation
	device. We acquired CT-scans for 39 deformed and 19 control skulls.
	We studied the thickness of the skull vault using qualitative and
	quantitative methods. We computed the volumes of the orbits, of the
	maxillary sinuses, and of the intracranial cavity using haptic-aided
	semi-automatic segmentation. We finally defined 3D distances and
	angles within orbits and maxillary sinuses based on 27 anatomical
	landmarks and measured these features on the 58 skulls. Our results
	show specific bone thickness patterns in some types of ICD, with
	localized thinning in regions subjected to increased pressure and
	thickening in other regions. Our findings confirm that volumes of
	the cranial cavities are not affected by ICDs but that the shapes
	of the orbits and of the maxillary sinuses are modified in circumferential
	deformations. We conclude that ICDs can modify the shape of the cranial
	cavities and the thickness of their walls but conserve their volumes.
	These results provide new insights into the morphological effects
	associated with ICDs and call for similar investigations in subjects
	with deformational plagiocephalies and craniosynostoses.},

  abstract = {Abstract:â?? Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images have
	been increasingly applied and accepted in forensic sciences. Along
	with radiographs and CT images, the frontal sinus is often used for
	the individual identification because of its unique and unchangeable
	characteristics. The purpose of this study is to define the usefulness
	of three-dimensional (3-D) images of the frontal sinus for identification.
	CT images from 119 Korean cadavers were built up for 3-D reconstruction
	and surveyed with 15 measurements. The total volume of the sinus,
	some nonmetric characteristics, and the bilateral asymmetry index
	in men differed significantly from those in women (pÂ <Â 0.05). The
	digit codes, six sections and 10-digit number, were almost able to
	accurately identify individuals (98%). This study showed a statistical
	difference between the sexes and classified the fused and prominent
	middle sinuses for the first time. This proposed method for identification
	is more accurate than those used in other studies.},

	malignancies. The purpose of this study is to present the CT and
	MRI findings of the periorbita with PNS malignancies. Materials and
	Methods: Ten patients with PNS cancers were chosen for this study.
	PNS CT and MRI scans were performed on all patients. The imaging
	findings were reviewed retrospectively by consensus of two neuroradiologists.
	Assessment of the defect of the orbital bone and invasion of the
	orbital fat was made by CT and MRI. The signal intensity (SI) thickness,
	enhancement, and correlation with the orbital bone of the periorbita
	were analyzed on MRI. The intraoperative and pathologic reports were
	used as the gold standard for orbital invasion. Results: In patients
	with bone defects, it was impossible to differentiate the periorbita
	from the mass on CT. The periorbita showed hypointensity on T2-weighted
	images compared with the SI of mass. On Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images,
	the periorbita showed less enhancement than the mass in nine patients.
	Six patients showed two hypointense layers (the outer bony wall and
	the inner periorbita) between the mass and orbital fat on T2-weighted
	images. The thickness of the periorbita was 0.79-1.4 millimeter.
	Orbital invasion was more conspicuous on T2-weighted coronal images
	than on the CT images. Conclusions: MRI was more conspicuous for
	detecting orbital invasion than CT. The mass beyond the thickened
	periorbita on T2-weighted images was considered to be a positive
	finding of orbital invasion.},

  abstract = {Abstract: One of the four pillars of the anthropological protocol
	is the estimation of sex. The protocol generally consists of linear
	metric analysis or visually assessing individual skeletal traits
	on the skull and pelvis based on an ordinal scale of 120135, ranging
	from very masculine to very feminine. The morphologic traits are
	then some how averaged by the investigator to estimate sex. Some
	skulls may be misclassified because of apparent morphologic features
	that appear more or less robust due to size differences among individuals.
	The question of misclassification may be further exemplified in light
	of comparisons across populations that may differ not only in cranial
	robusticity but also in stature and general physique. The purpose
	of this study is to further examine the effect of size and sex on
	craniofacial shape among American populations to better understand
	the allometric foundation of skeletal traits currently used for sex
	estimation. Three-dimensional coordinates of 16 standard craniofacial
	landmarks were collected using a Microscribe-3DX digitizer. Data
	were collected for 118 American White and Black males and females
	from the W.M. Bass Donated Collection and the Forensic Data Bank.
	The MANCOVA procedure tested shape differences as a function of sex
	and size. Sex had a significant influence on shape for both American
	Whites (F = 2.90; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.0024) and Blacks (F = 2.81;
	d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.0035), whereas size did not have a significant
	influence on shape in either Whites (F = 1.69; d.f. = 19, 39; p &gt; F = 0.08)
	or Blacks (F = 1.09; d.f. = 19, 37; p &gt; F = 0.40). Therefore,
	for each sex, individuals of various sizes were statistically the
	same shape. In other words, while significant differences were present
	between the size of males and females (males on average were larger),
	there was no size effect beyond that accounted for by sex differences
	in size. Moreover, the consistency between American groups is interesting
	as it suggests that population differences in sexual dimorphism may
	result more from human variation in size than allometric variation
	in craniofacial morphology.},

	landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified

	were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses
	showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting
	primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement
	of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS
	and control groups differed significantly and average directional
	asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in

	symmetry, for instance, the vertebrate skull. This type of symmetry
	is called object symmetry and is distinguished from matching symmetry,
	in which two separate structures exist as mirror images of each other,
	one on each body side. We explain a method for partitioning the total
	shape variation of landmark configurations with object symmetry into
	components of symmetric variation among individuals and asymmetry.
	This method is based on the Procrustes superimposition of the original
	and a reflected copy of each landmark configuration and is compatible
	with the two-factor ANOVA model customary in studies of fluctuating
	asymmetry. We show a fully multivariate framework for testing the
	effects in the two-factor model with MANOVA statistics, which also
	applies to shapes with matching symmetry. We apply the new methods
	in a small case study of pharyngeal jaws of the Neotropical cichlid
	fish Amphilophus citrinellus. The analysis revealed that the symmetric
	component of variation in the pharyngeal jaws is dominated by the
	contrast between two alternative trophic morphs in this species and
	that there is subtle but statistically significant directional asymmetry.
	Finally, we provide some general recommendations for morphometric
	studies of symmetric shapes.},

  abstract = {Although fluctuating asymmetry has become popular as a measure of
	developmental instability, few studies have examined its developmental
	basis. We propose an approach to investigate the role of development
	for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our
	approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA
	customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and
	can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the
	patterns of covariance among landmarks. This approach extends the
	notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections
	of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric
	concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks.
	We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings
	of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed
	significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well
	as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring
	of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly
	in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark
	covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally
	similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability)
	and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence
	that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry.
	We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to
	be involved in the development of fly wings.},

	movement, especially in the horizontal direction. Comparison of eye
	coloration and facial coloration around the eye suggested that the
	dark coloration of exposed sclera of nonhuman primates is an adaptation
	to camouflage the gaze direction against other individuals and/or
	predators, and that the white sclera of the human eye is an adaptation

	either to estimate characteristics of unidentified individuals or
	to serve as evidence in cases where there is a putative identification.
	In the estimation context, the problem is to describe aspects of
	an individual that may lead to their eventual identification, whereas
	in the evidentiary context, the problem is to provide the relative
	support for the identification. In either context, individual characteristics
	such as sex and race may be useful. Using a previously published
	forensic case (Steadman et al. (2006) Am J Phys Anthropol 131:15-26)
	and a large (N = 3,167) reference sample, we show that the sex of
	the individual can be reliably estimated using a small set of 11
	craniometric variables. The likelihood ratio from sex (assuming a
	1:1 sex ratio for the ldquopopulation at largerdquo) is, however,
	relatively uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification.
	Similarly, the known ldquoracerdquo of the individual is relatively
	uninformative in ldquomakingrdquo the identification, because the
	individual was recovered from an area where the 2000 US census provides
	a very homogenous picture of (self-identified) race. Of interest

  abstract = {In this article, we both contend and illustrate that biological anthropologists,
	particularly in the Americas, often think like Bayesians but act
	like frequentists when it comes to analyzing a wide variety of data.
	In other words, while our research goals and perspectives are rooted
	in probabilistic thinking and rest on prior knowledge, we often proceed
	to use statistical hypothesis tests and confidence interval methods
	unrelated (or tenuously related) to the research questions of interest.
	We advocate for applying Bayesian analyses to a number of different
	bioanthropological questions, especially since many of the programming
	and computational challenges to doing so have been overcome in the
	past two decades. To facilitate such applications, this article explains
	Bayesian principles and concepts, and provides concrete examples
	of Bayesian computer simulations and statistics that address questions
	relevant to biological anthropology, focusing particularly on bioarchaeology
	and forensic anthropology. It also simultaneously reviews the use
	of Bayesian methods and inference within the discipline to date.
	This article is intended to act as primer to Bayesian methods and
	inference in biological anthropology, explaining the relationships
	of various methods to likelihoods or probabilities and to classical
	statistical models. Our contention is not that traditional frequentist
	statistics should be rejected outright, but that there are many situations
	where biological anthropology is better served by taking a Bayesian
	approach. To this end it is hoped that the examples provided in this
	article will assist researchers in choosing from among the broad

  abstract = {SummaryIntroduction Orbital structures are affected in approximately
	40% of all cases of craniofacial trauma. Changes in the bony orbital
	dimensions can alter the function of intraorbital contents and lead
	to serious complications. The unique anatomy of the orbit and the
	resulting surgical approaches make the process of fitting and aligning
	implants difficult, time consuming and operator dependent. It is
	now possible to make relatively inexpensive anatomical models on
	the basis of computed tomography images, using rapid prototyping.
	Such models can be used as templates to form titanium mesh implants,
	which are then used in the reconstruction of orbital floor defects.Material
	and methods Six patients with facial trauma were included in this
	study. First, 3D virtual models and then physical models were created.
	These were used as templates to shape the titanium mesh and then
	intraoperatively as guides to aid correct implant placement in the
	orbit.Results Significant improvement resulted in three cases and
	total recovery in three cases.Conclusion It is financially viable
	to build anatomical models, on the basis of CT studies, that can
	be used in the repair of orbital floor fractures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Normal and abnormal jaw growth and tooth eruption are topics
	of great importance for several dental and medical disciplines. Thus
	far, clinical studies on these topics have used two-dimensional (2D)
	radiographic techniques. The purpose of the present study was to
	analyse normal mandibular growth and tooth eruption in three dimensions
	based on computer tomography (CT) scans, extending the principles
	of mandibular growth analysis proposed by Björk in 1969 from two
	to three dimensions. As longitudinal CT data from normal children
	are not available (for ethical reasons), CT data from children with
	Apert syndrome were employed, because it has been shown that the
	mandible in Apert syndrome is unaffected by the malformation, and
	these children often have several craniofacial CT scans performed
	during childhood for planning of cranial and midface surgery and
	for follow-up after surgery. A total of 49 datasets from ten children
	with Apert syndrome were available for study. The number of datasets
	from each individual ranged from three to seven. The first CT scan
	in each of the ten series was carried out before 1 year of age, and
	the ages for the 49 scans ranged from 1 week to 14.5 years. The mandible
	and the teeth were segmented and iso-surfaces generated. Landmarks
	were placed on the surface of the mandible, along the mandibular
	canals, the inner contour of the cortical plate at the lower border
	of the symphysis menti, and on the teeth. Superimposition of the
	mandibles in the longitudinal series was performed using the symphysis
	menti and the mandibular canals as suggested by Björk. The study
	supported the findings of stability of the symphysis menti and the
	mandibular canals as seen in profile view previously reported by
	Björk & Skieller in 1983. However, the mandibular canals were, actually,
	relocated laterally during growth. Furthermore, the position of tooth
	buds remained relatively stable inside the jaw until root formation
	started. Eruption paths of canines and premolars were vertical, whereas
	molars erupted in a lingual direction. The 3D method would seem to
	offer new insight into jaw growth and tooth eruption, but further
	studies are needed.},

	(PCA) and thin-plate splines (TPS) sufficient for determining facial
	morphology? Is it possible to identify relationships between cranial
	morphology, gender and facial profile? Material and Methods: &nbsp;&nbsp;Profile
	photos of 110 adult patients were measured according to A.M. Schwarz
	landmarks using Onyx Ceph. Centroid size was calculated from x and
	y-coordinates. After Procrustes transformation, a principal component
	analysis for identifying major components of facial morphology was
	performed and the results visualized using thin-plate splines. At
	the same time, lateral cephalograms of all patients were analyzed
	according to Hasund. Results: &nbsp;&nbsp;There were significant
	differences in centroid size betweeen male and female patients. Only
	the vertical skeletal structure had an impact on centroid size. Six
	components (PC1 to PC6) were identified using PCA. They were responsible
	for 86.5% of the variance. PC1 (33.9%) described scaling along an
	axis from Porion to chin. PC2 (28.6%) characterized the vertical
	dimensions of the lower face. Significant differences were only apparent
	between males and females in PC3 and PC4. In terms of cephalometric
	parameters, PC2 and PC3 differed in the vertical, and PC1 und PC2
	in the sagittal configuration. Conclusions: &nbsp;&nbsp;The analyses
	presented here suffice for describing facial morphology qualitatively
	and quantitatively as demonstrated by this example. Separating size
	from shape is useful for investigating therapeutically and growth-related
	morphological changes. It is difficult to draw conclusions about
	skeletal parameters.}

	problem. The dimensionality of the data is reduced by using principal
	component decompositions and the final tests are still based on the
	classical test statistics and their distributions. The methodology
	is illustrated with an example from the production of sausages with
	responses from near infra-red reflectance spectroscopy. A closely
	related method for testing relationships in uniresponse regression
	with collinear explanatory variables is also presented. The new test,
	which is called the 50-50 F-test, uses the first k components to
	calculate SS MODEL. The next d components are not involved in SS
	ERROR and they are called buffer components.},

	variables are coded as categorical or continuous. Overall testing
	of all responses is done by 50-50 MANOVA, which handles several highly
	correlated responses. Univariate p-values for each response are adjusted
	by using rotation testing. To illustrate multivariate effects, mean
	values and mean predictions are illustrated in a principal component
	score plot or directly as curves. For the unbalanced cases, we introduce
	a new variant of adjusted means, which are independent to the coding
	of two-level variables. The methodology is exemplified by case studies

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to construct a mesh-model of a newborn
	skull for finite element analysis to study its deformation when subjected
	to the forces present during labour. The current state of medical
	imaging technology has reached a level which allows accurate visualisation
	and shape recovery of biological organs and body-parts. However,
	a sufficiently large set of medical images cannot always be obtained,
	often because of practical or ethical reasons, and the requirement
	to recover the shape of the biological object of interest has to
	be met by other means. Such is the case for a newborn skull. A method
	to recover the three-dimensional (3D) shape from (minimum) two orthogonal
	atlas images of the object of interest and a homologous object is
	described. This method is based on matching landmarks and curves
	on the orthogonal images of the object of interest with corresponding
	landmarks and curves on the homologous or 'master'-object which is
	fully defined in 3D space. On the basis of this set of corresponding
	landmarks, a thin-plate spline function can be derived to warp from
	the 'master'-object space to the 'slave'-object space. This method
	is applied to recover the 3D shape of a newborn skull. Images from
	orthogonal view-planes are obtained from an atlas. The homologous
	object is an adult skull, obtained from CT-images made available
	by the Visible Human Project. After shape recovery, a mesh-model
	of the newborn skull is generated.},

	der MRT für die Orbitadiagnostik sind zwei Bereiche zu trennen, nämlich
	differentialdiagnostische Überlegungen und das Tumorstaging.   Patienten
	mit Veränderungen im Bereich der Orbita, die von einem Ophthalmologen
	zur MRT überwiesen werden, haben häufig schon eine sonographische
	oder computertomographische Diagnostik durchlaufen, sodass die MRT
	zur Differentialdiagnose nur noch wenig beitragen muss. Durch die
	Möglichkeit der MRT, Schnittbilder in allen Raumebenen anzufertigen,
	ist die Zuordnung von orbitalen Prozessen zu einem Orbitakompartiment
	und damit die differentialdiagnostische Einordnung erheblich leichter
	und genauer als bei der transversalen CT. So ist z. B. die Zuordnung
	eines vergrößerten M. rectus inferior im transversalen CT-Bild erheblich
	schwerer als im koronaren MRT-Bild. Die MRT ist gegenüber der CT
	darüber hinaus im Vorteil, weil durch den höheren Weichteilkontrast
	Gewebeinformationen verfügbar sind, die eine Differenzierung verschiedener
	Pathologien erlaubt. Lediglich beim Nachweis von Kalk ist die CT
	der MRT überlegen, was beispielsweise bei Veränderungen des Sehnervs
	(Optikusscheidenmeningeom) wegweisend sein kann. Besonders hervorzuheben
	für die Bedeutung der MRT ist die Diagnostik der endokrinen Orbitopathie:
	Hier ist die MRT in der Lage, durch Messung bzw. Berechnung quantitativer
	Parameter eine Aussage über den Akuitätsgrad der Erkrankung abzugeben,
	was direkte Auswirkungen auf das therapeutische Procedere hat. Auf
	der anderen Seite ist bei einem bekannten Tumor das Tumorstaging
	vor Beginn einer Therapie von entscheidender Bedeutung, so z. B.
	bei präseptalen Tumoren, Bulbustumoren, aber auch sämtlichen retrobulbären
	Tumoren. Die MRT ermöglicht hier eine Weichteildifferenzierung, wie
	sie mit der CT nicht und mit der Sonographie nur zum Teil erreicht
	wird. Erst im Bereich der Orbitaspitze und bei knöchernen Veränderungen
	ist die CT der MRT meist überlegen.},

	Abstracts that appeared to fulfill the initial selection criteria
	were selected by consensus. The original articles were then retrieved
	and their references hand-searched for possible missing articles.Results
	A total of 8 articles met the selection criteria. Differences between
	the magnitudes of errors of landmarks and their associated measurements
	were discussed.Conclusions It was concluded that each landmark exhibited
	a characteristic pattern of error that contributed to measurement
	inaccuracy, and with repeated practice of landmark identifications,
	the error can be reduced to within 0.5 mm for 2-D CT. Considerations
	have to be given to some of the 3-D CT reliability values because
	they can have diagnosis implications.}

  abstract = {CT scanning and MR imaging of the eye and orbit have significantly
	enhanced the diagnosis of ocular and orbital lesions [1-21]. The
	anatomy and pathologic findings of the bony orbit, surrounding structures
	of the eye, and optic pathways can now be visualized with exquisite
	detail, so that the diagnosis of pathologic conditions can be made
	with much more certainty than in the past [1-21]. The evolution of
	advanced technologies has greatly influenced and aided in the differentiation
	of orbital and ocular lesions. Oplithalmologic diagnostic evaluation,
	in particular, has significantly improved with the use of imaging
	modalities such as ultrasound and MR imaging. The increasing availability
	of clinical highfield MR imaging at 3 Tesla (3-T) scanners holds
	the promise of making 3-T MR imaging scanners more available for
	routine clinical use. The purpose of this article is to describe
	the application of the 3-T MR imaging scanner in orbital and ocular
	pathologic findings and, in particular, whether the 3-T MR imaging
	scanner improves the imaging evaluation of orbital and ocular lesions.
	In keeping with the purpose of this issue, we review the MR imaging
	characteristics of selected patients (Table 1) who presented with
	various orbital and ocular disorders and underwent scanning on a
	3-T MR imaging scanner. Some of these patients also underwent scanning
	on a 1.5-T MR imaging unit. An attempt is made to emphasize the diagnostic
	patterns of common orbital and ocular lesions on 3-T MR imaging sequences.},

	anterior and vertical position of the pronasale), in general, the
	method of Rynn et al. (Forensic Sci Med Pathol 6, 2010, 20) was found
	to perform better and with less error variance than the method of
	Stephan et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 122, 2003, 240), but the mean
	difference between the actual and predicted values did not exceed
	2.2Â mm (6.5% of the actual dimension) in most of the variables tested.
	The vertical dimensions of the nose were predictable with greater
	accuracy than the horizontal dimensions. Although the mean error
	of both methods is not great in practice and thus both methods could
	be considered to be "accurate" the real variance of error should
	not be overlooked.},

	Norway The aim of this inter-disciplinary book is to present an up-to-date
	view of multivariate calibration of analytical instruments, for use
	in research, development and routine laboratory and process operation.
	The book is intended to show practitioners in chemistry and technology
	how to extract the quantitative and understandable information embedded
	in non-selective, overwhelming and apparently useless measurements
	by multivariate data analysis. Multivariate calibration is the process
	of learning how to combine data from several channels, in order to
	overcome selectivity problems, gain new insight and allow automatic
	outlier detection. Multivariate calibration is the basis for the
	present success of high-speed {Near-Infrared} {(NIR)} diffuse spectroscopy
	of intact samples. But the technique is very general: it has shown
	similar advantages in, for instance, {UV}, Vis, and {IR} spectrophotometry,
	(transmittance, reflectance and fluorescence), for x-ray diffraction,
	{NMR}, {MS}, thermal analysis, chromatography {(GC}, {HPLC)} and
	for electrophoresis and image analysis (tomography, microscopy),
	as well as other techniques. The book is written at two levels: the
	main level is structured as a tutorial on the practical use of multivariate
	calibration techniques. It is intended for university courses and
	self-study for chemists and technologists, giving one complete and
	versatile approach, based mainly on data compression methodology
	in self-modelling {PLS} regression, with considerations of experimental
	design, data pre-processing and model validation. A second, more
	methodological, level is intended for statisticians and specialists
	in chemometrics. It compares several alternative calibration methods,
	validation approaches and ways to optimize the models. The book also
	outlines some cognitive changes needed in analytical chemistry, and
	suggests ways to overcome some communication problems between statistics
	and chemistry and technology.},

	This investigation is conducted using 3D Fisherfaces and demonstrates

	In fact, comparable performance can be achieved using significantly

	is integrated into the region ensemble framework and is shown to
	improve performance over a single normalization of the ensemble match
	score. Performance improvement is particularly evident at low false

	obtains a 97.1% True Accept Rate (TAR) at 0.1% False Accept Rate
	(FAR) when the approach is trained with 100 subjects and improves

	to identify distances to intraorbital fissures, canals, and foramina.
	Safe distances to the optic nerve were identified by subtracting

	quadrant, 38 mm; and lateral quadrant, 36 mm. Staying close to the

  abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a multivariate classification
	technique frequently applied to morphometric data in various biomedical
	disciplines. Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization
	of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style
	of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the
	data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance
	matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear
	functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices,
	which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number
	of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear
	separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population.
	Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation
	require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative
	to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components
	of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these
	axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not
	of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in
	samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous.
	In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is
	identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function
	between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured
	variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions
	and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized
	as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics
	and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically
	offer no interpretation as biological factors.},

	on Cartesian landmark coordinates. After separating shape from overall
	size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the
	resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical
	analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by
	the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated
	locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity)
	between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and
	evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space.
	Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient
	properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression,
	or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes
	or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and
	its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape
	space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates
	with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in
	geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small
	isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation
	function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D
	visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks
	and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines
	and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization
	tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of
	shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis,
	allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown

	has been developed to use surface information for registering volumes.
	Surface extraction is performed in two steps: extraction of contours
	in {2-D} image planes using active contours, and forming triangular
	patch surface models from the stack of {2-D} contours. One volume
	is modeled as being deformed with respect to another goal volume.
	Correspondences between surfaces in the two image volumes are used
	to warp the deformed volume towards its goal. This process of contour
	extraction, surface formation and matching, and warping is repeated
	a number of times, with decreasing image volume stiffness. As the
	iterations continue the stretched volume is refined towards its goal
	volume. Registration examples of deformed volumes are presented.},

  abstract = {Recently developed methods for power analysis expand the options available
	for study design. We demonstrate how easily the methods can be applied
	by (1) reviewing their formulation and (2) describing their application
	in the preparation of a particular grant proposal. The focus is a
	complex but ubiquitous setting: repeated measures in a longitudinal
	study. Describing the development of the research proposal allows
	demonstrating the steps needed to conduct an effective power analysis.
	Discussion of the example also highlights issues that typically must
	be considered in designing a study. First, we discuss the motivation
	for using detailed power calculations, focusing on multivariate methods
	in particular. Second, we survey available methods for the general
	linear multivariate model (GLMM) with Gaussian errors and recommend
	those based on F approximations. The treatment includes coverage
	of the multivariate and univariate approaches to repeated measures,
	MANOVA, ANOVA, multivariate regression, and univariate regression.
	Third, we describe the design of the power analysis for the example,
	a longitudinal study of a child's intellectual performance as a function
	of mother's estimated verbal intelligence. Fourth, we present the
	results of the power calculations. Fifth, we evaluate the tradeoffs
	in using reduced designs and tests to simplify power calculations.
	Finally, we discuss the benefits and costs of power analysis in the
	practice of statistics. We make three recommendations: 1. Align the
	design and hypothesis of the power analysis with the planned data
	analysis, as best as practical. 2. Embed any power analysis in a
	defensible sensitivity analysis. 3. Have the extent of the power
	analysis reflect the ethical, scientific, and monetary costs. We
	conclude that power analysis catalyzes the interaction of statisticians
	and subject matter specialists. Using the recent advances for power
	analysis in linear models can further invigorate the interaction.},

	for the central case. Much less calculation is needed than for earlier
	approximations and accuracy appears not to suffer in practice. An
	upper bound F approximation is provided for the largest root power.
	Power calculation can be used to help choose a test statistic as

	for estimating power, using standard linear models programs [20],

	The overall mean effect size of heritabilities of individual fluctuating
	asymmetry was 0.19 from 34 studies of 17 species differing highly

	genetic component to developmental stability. Effect size was larger
	for selection experiments than for studies based on parent-offspring
	regression or sib analyses, implying that genetic estimates were
	unbiased by maternal or common environment effects. Additive genetic
	coefficients of variation for individual fluctuating asymmetry were
	considerably higher than those for character size per se. Developmental
	stability may be significantly heritable either because of strong
	directional selection, or fluctuating selection regimes which prevent

  abstract = {Human mandibular morphology is often thought to reflect mainly function,
	and to be of lesser value in studies of population history. Previous
	descriptions of human mandibles showed variation in ramal height
	and breadth to be the strongest difference among recent human groups.
	Several mandibular traits that differentiate Neanderthals from modern
	humans include greater robusticity, a receding symphysis, a large
	retromolar space, a rounder gonial area, an asymmetric mandibular
	notch, and a posteriorly positioned mental foramen in Neanderthals.
	Nevertheless, the degree to which these differences are part of modern
	human variation and/or are related to size and function remains unclear.
	The aim of this study was to document geographic and functional patterning
	in the mandibular shape of recent humans, to assess the effects of
	allometry on mandibular form, and to quantitatively evaluate proposed
	"Neanderthal" mandibular traits through comparison with samples of
	geographically diverse recent humans. Data were collected in the
	form of three-dimensional coordinates of 28 landmarks. Unlike previous
	studies, this analysis found that modern human mandibular shape exhibits
	considerable geographic patterning, with some aspects of mandibular
	morphology reflecting a climatic gradient, and others, a functional
	specialization. Population history is also reflected in mandibular
	form, albeit relatively weakly. Proposed "Neanderthal" traits were
	found to separate Neanderthal from modern human mandibles successfully
	in the statistical analysis. Of these, the retromolar gap was found
	to be related to increased mandibular size in modern humans. The
	status of this trait as a Neanderthal autapomorphy should therefore
	be treated with caution.},

  abstract = {Abstract The nasal cavity is essential for humidifying and warming
	the air before it reaches the sensitive lungs. Because humans inhabit
	environments that can be seen as extreme from the perspective of
	respiratory function, nasal cavity shape is expected to show climatic
	adaptation. This study examines the relationship between modern human
	variation in the morphology of the nasal cavity and the climatic
	factors of temperature and vapor pressure, and tests the hypothesis
	that within increasingly demanding environments (colder and drier),
	nasal cavities will show features that enhance turbulence and air-wall
	contact to improve conditioning of the air. We use three-dimensional
	geometric morphometrics methods and multivariate statistics to model
	and analyze the shape of the bony nasal cavity of 10 modern human
	population samples from five climatic groups. We report significant
	correlations between nasal cavity shape and climatic variables of
	both temperature and humidity. Variation in nasal cavity shape is
	correlated with a cline from cold-dry climates to hot-humid climates,
	with a separate temperature and vapor pressure effect. The bony nasal
	cavity appears mostly associated with temperature, and the nasopharynx
	with humidity. The observed climate-related shape changes are functionally
	consistent with an increase in contact between air and mucosal tissue
	in cold-dry climates through greater turbulence during inspiration
	and a higher surface-to-volume ratio in the upper nasal cavity. Am

	considerable overlap between the sexes. Although different tendencies

	(Soc Sci Med 34 107-111), who hypothesized that American forensic
	anthropologists are good at what they do because of a concordance
	between social race and skeletal morphology in American whites and
	blacks. However, Sauer also stressed that this concordance did not
	validate the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology
	that there are a relatively small number of discrete types of human
	beings. Results from Howells (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 67 1-259; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 79 1-189; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology
	and Ethnology 82 1-108) and others using craniometric and molecular
	data show strong geographic patterning of human variation despite
	overlap in their distributions. However, Williams et al. (Curr Anthropol
	46 340-346) concluded that skeletal morphology cannot be used to
	accurately classify individuals. Williams et al. cited additional
	support from Lewontin (Evol Biol 6 381-398), who analyzed classic
	genetic markers. In this study, multivariate analyses of craniometric
	data support Sauer's hypothesis that there are morphological differences
	between American whites and blacks. We also confirm significant geographic
	patterning in human variation but also find differences among groups
	within continents. As a result, if biological races are defined by
	uniqueness, then there are a very large number of biological races
	that can be defined, contradicting the classic biological race concept
	of physical anthropology. Further, our results show that humans can
	be accurately classified into geographic origin using craniometrics
	even though there is overlap among groups. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009.

  abstract = {The ability to warp three-dimensional (3D) meshes from known biological
	morphology to fit other known, predicted or hypothetical morphologies
	has a range of potential applications in functional morphology and
	biomechanics. One of the most challenging of these applications is
	Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive
	tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics
	is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in
	morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens
	to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of
	these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping
	approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible.
	Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based
	on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach
	in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model. We further
	present new statistical approaches, strain frequency plots and landmark
	point strains, to analyse FEA results quantitatively and further
	integrate FEA with geometric morphometrics. Using strain frequency
	plots, strain field, bending displacements and landmark point strain
	data we demonstrate that the mechanical behaviour of warped specimens
	reproduces that of targets without significant error. The influence
	of including internal cavity morphology in FEA models was also examined
	and shown to increase bending displacements and strain magnitudes
	in FE models. The warping approaches presented here will be useful
	in a range of applications including the generation and analysis
	of virtual reconstructions, generic models that approximate species
	means, hypothetical morphologies and evolutionary intermediaries.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, geometric morphometric methods have been applied
	increasingly to the study of human form. When too few landmarks are
	available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points.
	The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so
	as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous
	from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not.
	This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy
	(BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference
	form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes
	necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained.
	We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement,
	principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human
	molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the
	two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar
	for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both
	criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample
	variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes
	obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification
	is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant
	scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can
	alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small,
	as in the analysis of modern human populations.},

  abstract = {Background: The clinical observation has been made that the shape
	of the mandible changes with age in certain individuals. Because
	the shape and size of the mandible are so important to the human
	perception of youth, this observation was subjected to a pilot study.
	Methods: Longitudinal data available at the Bolton Brush Growth Study
	were evaluated. Only dentate individuals were included in the study.
	Serial frontal radiographs were analyzed from the same individual
	taken during youth and maturity for 16 individuals, eight female
	subjects and eight male subjects (n = 16). The mean age for youth
	was 16.2 years for female and male subjects. The mean age at maturity
	was 56.1 years for female subjects and 56.4 years for male subjects.
	Tracings were made of the mandibular border for each individual,
	at youth and at maturity. The only reliable way to analyze shape
	is the modern technique of geometric morphometric analysis, which
	was therefore used in this study. Other techniques, such as angular
	values and two-dimensional linear measurements, were dismissed because
	they have been shown to be unreliable for evaluating shape. Results:
	There was a statistically significant difference in shape for both
	male subjects and female subjects that occurred with age (p = 0.02
	for female subjects and p = 0.001 for male subjects). The mandible
	continued to grow: the shape changed because some areas continued
	to grow faster than other areas. This is in accordance with the principle
	of differential growth of the facial skeleton. Conclusions: It is
	important for the cosmetic surgeon to evaluate the lower face before
	surgery and to understand that both bone and soft tissue can play
	a role in the appearance of the lower face in older individuals.
	A small lower face is highly attractive and conveys the impression
	of youth, and any soft-tissue procedure that can create the illusion
	of a diminutive lower face will improve the cosmetic result of the
	face lift procedure.},

	of preservation of the original material, we applied entirely noninvasive
	methods of fossil reconstruction and morphometry, using a combination
	of computed tomography, computer graphics, and stereolithography.After
	electronic restoration, the isolated original pieces were recomposed
	on the computer screen using external and internal anatomical clues
	to position the bone fragments and mirror images to complete missing
	parts. The inferred effects of general compressive deformation that
	occurred during fossilization were corrected by virtual decompression
	of the skull. The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier
	1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal
	adult state. Residual asymmetry of skeletal parts can be traced to
	in vivo skeletal modification: the left mandibular joint shows signs
	of a healed condylar fracture, and the anatomy of the occipital region
	suggests mild plagiocephaly.Using micro-CT analysis, the left incus
	could be recovered from the matrix filling of the middle ear cavity.
	Its morphometric dimensions are similar to those of the La Ferrassie
	III incus. The morphometric characteristics of the inner ear deviate
	substantially from the condition reported as typical for Neanderthals
	and fall within the range of modern human variability. Anat Rec 254:474--489,

	eye color. The first model assumed eye color to be categorized into
	blue, brown, green, and hazel, while the second variant assumed a
	simplified classification with two states: light and dark. It was
	found that particularly high accuracy was obtained for the second
	model, and this proved that reliable differentiation between light
	and dark irises is possible based on analysis of six single nucleotide
	polymorphisms and a Bayesian procedure of evidence interpretation.},

	evolution and skeletal biology. Sexual dimorphic characteristics
	can be studied morphologically and metrically, although morphologic
	studies pose several problems such as difficulties with quantification
	and interobserver error. Geometric morphometrics is a relatively
	new method that allows better assessment of morphologic characteristics.
	This paper aims to investigate the usability of this method by assessing
	three different morphologic characteristics in a sample of South
	African blacks: shape of the greater sciatic notch, mandibular ramus
	flexure, and shape of the orbits. Relative warps, thin-plate splines,
	and canonical variates analysis (CVA) analyses were performed. As
	expected, the shape of the greater sciatic notch provided the best
	separation between the sexes. Surprisingly, however, the shape of
	the orbits performed better that ramus flexure. Several possible
	explanations for this result are possible, which include the possibility
	that orbit shape is more sexually dimorphic than previously expected,
	or that biological reality is not reflected by this technique. More
	research is, however, needed.},

	racial classification. Developments in quantitative population genetics
	have allowed global comparison of patterns of phenotypic variation
	with patterns of variation in classical genetic markers and DNA markers.
	Human skin color shows a high degree of variation among geographic
	regions, typical of traits that show extensive natural selection.
	Even given this high level of geographic differentiation, skin color
	variation is clinal and is not well described by discrete racial
	categories. Craniometric traits show a level of among-region differentiation
	comparable to genetic markers, with high levels of variation within
	populations as well as a correlation between phenotypic and geographic
	distance. Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing
	high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from
	different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global
	variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race
	concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them
	are arbitrary. The race concept is at best a crude first-order approximation
	to the geographically structured phenotypic variation in the human
	species. Am J Phys Anthropol 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA have found
	that the amount of variation among major geographic groupings of
	Homo sapiens is relatively low, accounting for roughly 10% of total
	variation. This conclusion has had implications for the study of
	human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin
	of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the
	level of among-group variation for morphological traits is much higher.
	This study examines the level of among-group variation based on craniometric
	data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by
	W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics
	theory was used to provide an estimate of FST--a measure of among-group
	variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic
	markers. Data for 57 craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were
	analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub-Saharan
	Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An
	additional set of analyses was performed using a three-region subset
	(Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability
	with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete
	heritability) for the three-region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum
	FST for the six-region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less
	than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10-0.11).
	The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since
	it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability.
	Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature
	provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three-region analysis
	and 0.144 for the six-region analysis. These results show that genetic
	and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively,
	and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major
	geographic regions.},

	The so-called Full-Metadata Format builds on the widely used INI-standard
	and is based on four principles: readable self-documentation, flexible
	structure, fail-safe compatibility, and searchability. As a consequence,
	all metadata required to interpret the tabular data are stored in
	the same file, allowing for the automated generation of publication-ready
	tables and graphs and the semantic searchability of data file collections.
	The Full-Metadata Format is introduced on the basis of three comprehensive
	examples. The complete format and syntax are given in the appendix.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the relationship of skeletal facial pattern
	and soft-tissue nasal form. The case sample comprises 123 white female
	subjects, aged 11.0 to 20.6 years, with no histories of pathology,
	trauma, surgical intervention, or orthodontic treatment. Measurements
	were made from cephalometric radiographs, posteroanterior radiographs,
	and the physioprint photographs. Skeletal classifications were based
	on the relationship of the maxilla to the mandible; the three classifications
	were straight profile, retrusive chin profile, and prognathic profile.
	Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to test
	intercorrelations of all quantitative variables (including age) with
	each other. Correlations were highly significant for age, the three
	profile measurements, and two of the frontal measurements. Hence,
	noses and skeletal structures showed, as expected, increases with
	age. Also, profile measurements were highly significantly correlated;
	larger noses were larger in all profile dimensions. A stepwise discriminant
	analysis was used to study nonquantitative categories of nasal shape
	(straight, convex, and concave). This analysis indicated that more
	than 86% of patients in the sample of 123 demonstrated a correlation
	of nasal shapes with specific skeletal groupings. Patients with straight
	profiles tended to have straight noses; convex profiles accompanied
	convex nasal shapes; and concave profiles were found with concave
	nasal shapes. The clinical significance of this research is to emphasize
	the importance of total facial harmony (especially nasal shape) during
	orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.},

	When true shapes are known to be smooth, dropping higher-order Fourier

  abstract = {The relationship between allometry and sexual dimorphism in the human
	craniofacial complex was analyzed using geometric morphometric methods.
	Thin-plate splines (TPS) analysis has been applied to investigate
	the lateral profile of complete adult skulls of known sex. Twenty-nine
	three-dimensional (3D) craniofacial and mandibular landmark coordinates
	were recorded from a sample of 52 adult females and 52 adult males
	of known age and sex. No difference in the influence of size on shape
	was detected between sexes. Both size and sex had significant influences
	on shape. As expected, the influence of centroid size on shape (allometry)
	revealed a shift in the proportions of the neurocranium and the viscerocranium,
	with a marked allometric variation of the lower face. Adjusted for
	centroid size, males presented a relatively larger size of the nasopharyngeal
	space than females. A mean-male TPS transformation revealed a larger
	piriform aperture, achieved by an increase of the angulation of the
	nasal bones and a downward rotation of the anterior nasal floor.
	Male pharynx expansion was also reflected by larger choanae and a
	more posteriorly inclined basilar part of the occipital clivus. Male
	muscle attachment sites appeared more pronounced. In contrast, the
	mean-female TPS transformation was characterized by a relatively
	small nasal aperture. The occipital clivus inclined anteriorly, and
	muscle insertion areas became smoothed. Besides these variations,
	both maxillary and mandibular alveolar regions became prognathic.
	The sex-specific TPS deformation patterns are hypothesized to be
	associated with sexual differences in body composition and energetic
	requirements.},

  abstract = {In both diagnostic fields a two-stage strategy is recommended: to
	first use "field" methods that are quick and easy but more imprecise
	and then "laboratory" methods that are time consuming but more precise.
	In preparing skeletal work, individuality of a skeleton should be
	checked, traces of diseases sought and time since death assessed.
	For sexing non-adults, the field methods are tooth mineralisation,
	long bone length and a few morphological skull and pelvis characteristics,
	for adults it is the morphology of pelvis and skull, and for both
	age groups the advanced laboratory method is molecular biology. For
	ageing non-adults the methods are mineralisation of teeth, long bone
	length and epiphysis development. For ageing adults the advanced
	laboratory method is aspartic acid racemisation. Less accurate laboratory
	methods are cement ring counts and histology of bones and teeth.
	Quick morphological methods using the pubic symphysis and other traits
	in combinations follow. Finally, cranial sutures and tooth number
	give a quick and rough impression. For the selection of a method
	and the assessment of its value the stochastic error produced for
	the reference sample is the decisive criterion; it should also be
	used to assess the reliability of a single diagnosis. Prerequisites
	for all work with skeletons are not only a complete knowledge of
	the relevant biology as well as specific techniques but also initial
	detailed instructions and with forensic applications, personal experience.},

  abstract = {By providing two examples, the option for embedding 3D models in electronic
	versions of life science publications is presented. These examples,
	presumably representing the first such models published, are developmental
	stages of an evertebrate (Patella caerulea, Mollusca) and a vertebrate
	species (Psetta maxima, Teleostei) obtained from histological section
	series reconstruction processed with the software package Amira.
	These surface rendering models are particularly suitable for a PDF
	file because they can easily be transformed to a file format required
	and components may be conveniently combined and hierarchically arranged.
	All methodological steps starting from specimen preparation until
	embedding of resulting models in PDF files with emphasis on conversion
	of Amira data to the appropriate 3D file format are explained. Usability
	of 3D models in PDF documents is exemplified and advantages over
	2D illustrations are discussed, including better explanation capabilities
	for spatial arrangements, higher information contents, and limiting
	options for disguising results by authors. Possibilities for additional
	applications reaching far beyond the examples presented are suggested.
	Problems such as long-term compatibility of file format and hardware
	plus software, editing and embedding of files, file size and differences
	in information contents between printed and electronic version will
	likely be overcome by technical development and increasing tendency
	toward electronic at the cost of printed publications. Since 3D visualization
	plays an increasing role in manifold disciplines of science and appropriate
	tools for the popular PDF format are readily available, we propose
	routine application of this way of illustration in electronic life

	in which changes are not a function of any mean or average, but only
	of the current state. Geometric morphometrics, a toolkit for assessing
	and visualizing biological form and its covariates, avoids some of
	the traditional pitfalls by focusing directly on the analysis of

	We discuss its potential relevance to phenotypic and developmental

	two useful analyses: assessment of asymmetry, and appraisal of integration.
	We itemize some of our previous studies on causes (inbreeding, environmental
	circumstances, etc.) and consequences (attractiveness perception)
	of asymmetry in humans, present some findings relating to the impact
	of sex on shape, and speculate about the adaptive relevance of one
	of these processes in particular. A closing argument points out that

	qualitative in the classical literature, and characterised by adjectives
	such as circular, rectangular or quadrangular. In order to provide
	a precise quantification and interpretation of this shape, a study
	based on automatic image analysis and Fourier analysis was carried
	out on 45 human skulls (30 males, 15 females), and for comparison
	on 61 skulls of Gorilla gorilla (40 males, 21 females), and 34 skulls
	of Pan troglodytes (20 males, 14 females). Sexual dimorphism in the
	shape of the orbital opening was not demonstrated. Its dominant morphological
	features could be characterized by Fourier analysis; elliptical elongation
	and quadrangularity were dominant morphological features of the shape
	of the orbital opening in the three species. Elliptical elongation
	was more marked in humans and Pan, whereas quadrangularity was particularly
	emphasized in Gorilla. An intraspecific variability of the shape
	of the orbital opening existed in humans, Gorilla and Pan, and seemed
	close in the three species. Interspecific partition between humans,
	Gorilla and Pan was demonstrated despite the variability observed
	in the three species studied. Interspecific differences between Gorilla
	and the Pan-humans group were principally explained by the differences
	in quadrangularity, and by differences in orientation of triangularity
	and pentagonality. Differences in the shape of the orbital opening
	between humans and Pan were principally explained by differences
	in hexagonality, and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity.
	A closeness of shape between some humans and some individuals in
	Pan and, to a lesser degree, with some individuals in Gorilla was
	observed, demonstrating the existence of a morphological continuum
	of the shape of the orbital opening in hominoids.},

  abstract = {Summary An original procedure based on new developments in elliptical
	Fourier methods associated with image analysis technics was applied
	to 117 human mandibles in lateral view (69 males, 48 females) in
	order to analyze interindividual variability and sexual dimorphism.
	Original parameters, called elliptical Fourier descriptors, allowed
	for the quantification of the shape of an outline irrespective of
	its morphological complexity, and provided a precise individual characterization.
	The use of step by step reconstructions with an increasing number
	of harmonics allowed for demonstration of the morphological contributions
	of the elliptical Fourier descriptors, and relationships to precise
	anatomical features were established. The first harmonics (1st to
	8th) described the general mandibular shape, and the later harmonics
	(8th to 14th) characterized accessory and finer morphological features.
	The proportion of individuals presenting significant sexual dimorphism
	was 97.1% in males and 91.7% in females, and after size normalization
	84.1% in males and 81.2% in females. Even after removal of the size
	component, these results in regard to mandibular dimorphism remained
	better than those found by classical approaches; this could be due
	to the use of elliptical Fourier analysis which takes into account
	all the information of the mandibular outline. Compared to the size
	component, the shape component seemed to be more important in the
	sexual dimorphism of the human mandible than previously recognized.
	The present approach opens interesting anthropological and clinical
	perspectives for the characterization of mandibular morphology.},

  abstract = {Two methods for registering laser-scans of human heads and transforming
	them to a new semantically consistent topology defined by a user-provided
	template mesh are described. Both algorithms are stated within the
	Iterative Closest Point framework. The first method is based on finding
	landmark correspondences by iteratively registering the vicinity
	of a landmark with a re-weighted error function. Thin-plate spline
	interpolation is then used to deform the template mesh and finally
	the scan is resampled in the topology of the deformed template. The
	second algorithm employs a morphable shape model, which can be computed
	from a database of laser-scans using the first algorithm. It directly
	optimizes pose and shape of the morphable model. The use of the algorithm
	with PCA mixture models, where the shape is split up into regions
	each described by an individual subspace, is addressed. Mixture models
	require either blending or regularization strategies, both of which
	are described in detail. For both algorithms, strategies for filling
	in missing geometry for incomplete laser-scans are described. While
	an interpolation-based approach can be used to fill in small or smooth
	regions, the modeldriven algorithm is capable of fitting a plausible
	complete head mesh to arbitrarily small geometry, which is known
	as "shape completion". The importance of regularization in the case
	of extreme shape completion is shown.},

	craniofacial complex. No current normative data exist for Northern
	Sudanese subjects. In the current study information about normal
	sex- and age-related dimensions of the orbital region was provided.
	The three-dimensional coordinates of ten landmarks on the orbital
	soft tissues were obtained using a hand-held laser scanner in 654
	healthy Northern Sudanese subjects aged 4-30 years. From the landmarks,
	biocular and intercanthal widths, paired height and inclination of
	the orbit relative to both the true horizontal (head in natural head
	position) and Frankfurt plane, length and inclination of the eye
	fissure, the relevant ratios, were calculated, and averaged for age
	and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance.
	All analysed linear soft-tissue orbital dimensions, except intercanthal
	width and left orbital height, were significantly larger in men than
	in women (p < 0.01). A significant sexual dimorphism was found also
	for the height-to-width ratios (larger in women in most age groups),
	the orbital inclinations vs. the true horizontal and Frankfurt plane
	(both measurements were almost always larger in men than in women),
	and the right side inclination of the eye fissure vs. the true horizontal
	(larger in women than in men), while no sex-related differences were
	observed for the left side inclination of the eye fissure vs. the
	true horizontal. All measurements but the right side inclination
	of the eye fissure vs. the true horizontal underwent significant
	modifications as a function of age, with several significant age
	x sex interactions. Biocular and intercanthal widths, orbital height,
	length of the eye fissure, all increased from childhood to young
	adulthood; in the second decade of life all age-related increments
	were larger in men than in women. Overall, when compared to literature
	data for African and Caucasoid subjects, several differences were
	found, pointing to the necessity of ethnic-specific data. Data collected
	in the present investigation could serve as a database for the quantitative
	description of human orbital morphology during normal growth and
	development. Forensic applications (evaluations of traumas, craniofacial
	alterations, teratogenic-induced conditions, facial reconstruction,
	ageing of living and dead people, personal identification) may also
	benefit from age- and sex-based data banks.},

  abstract = {The microanatomy of the superior orbital fissure (SOF) was studied
	in 96 sides of cadaver specimens. The SOF is a narrow bony cleft
	that lies at the apex of the orbit between the greater and lesser
	wings of the sphenoid. Through this fissure, many important structures
	enter the orbit from the middle cranial fossa including the third,
	fourth, sixth cranial nerves, and the ophthalmic branch of the fifth
	nerve. In addition, the superior opthalmamic vein exits the orbit
	to drain into the cavernous sinus via the SOF. The fissure can be
	divided into three anatomical regions by the annulus of Zinn (common
	annular tendon): the lateral, central, and inferior regions. The
	lateral wall of the SOF can also be divided between the upper and
	lower segments, and the angle between them was measured to be 144.27
	degrees +/- 20.03 degrees. Defining these regions is useful in describing
	the course and placement of the nerves and vasculature in the SOF.
	Managing lesions at the orbital apex requires an extensive knowledge
	of the cranial base and the intracranial and extracranial relationships
	of the anatomical structures coursing through the SOF. The goal of
	this study was to describe the microanatomy of the SOF region in
	detail and to provide a reference for surgical procedures involving
	the orbital apex.},

	Elliptic Fourier transforms of the contours were used to extract
	Fourier coefficients for statistical analysis. After cross-validation,
	discriminant functions based on the Fourier coefficients provided
	an average of 86% correct classifications for crania from the three
	groups. The high rate of accuracy of this method indicates its usefulness
	for identifying group affinities among human skeletal remains and
	demonstrates the advantages of digital 3D model-based analysis in

	but its variation has not been related to cranial morphology. To
	investigate this relationship, measurements of facial soft-tissue
	depths and craniometric dimensions were taken on adult, white Australian
	cadavers (17 male and 23 female). Significant correlations between
	many soft-tissue depths and craniometric dimensions were found, suggesting
	a relationship between the amount of soft tissue present on the face
	and the size of the underlying bony skeleton. Soft-tissue depths
	were highly positively correlated with each other; craniometric dimensions
	were correlated but to a lesser extent. Males had thicker soft tissues
	and larger craniometric dimensions than females; considerable overlap
	of ranges was also noted. Multiple regression analysis was used to
	produce equations predicting the soft-tissue depth at specified areas
	of the face from craniometric dimensions. A subsample of nine cadavers
	was examined for the effects of tissue embalming. Embalming caused
	significant initial increases in facial soft-tissue depths. Cadavers
	embalmed for less than 6 months had soft-tissue depths significantly
	greater than for fully embalmed cadavers. The evidence that facial
	soft-tissue thicknesses vary with craniofacial dimensions has implications
	for forensic identification, facial aesthetic surgery, and approximation
	of the facial features of extinct individuals. Am J Phys Anthropol

  abstract = {Face recognition is a natural human ability and a widely accepted
	identification and authentication method. In modern legal settings,
	a lot of credence is placed on identifications made by eyewitnesses.
	Consequently these are based on human perception which is often flawed
	and can lead to situations where identity is disputed. Therefore,
	there is a clear need to secure identifications in an objective way
	based on anthropometric measures. Anthropometry has existed for many
	years and has evolved with each advent of new technology and computing
	power. As a result of this, face recognition methodology has shifted
	from a purely 2D image-based approach to the use of 3D facial shape.
	However, one of the main challenges still remaining is the non-rigid
	structure of the face, which can change permanently over varying
	time-scales and briefly with facial expressions. The majority of
	face recognition methods have been developed by scientists with a
	very technical background such as biometry, pattern recognition and

  abstract = {We present a new measure of morphological asymmetry that avoids most
	of the statistical problems inherent in character-by-character analysis
	of size or shape. The method is an application of Procrustes analysis,
	which computes best-fitting super-positions of configurations of
	landmarks to the left and right sides of a single specimen. The Procrustes
	method combines subtle deviations in all aspects of the landmark
	configuration into one net asymmetry score. Directional asymmetry
	is separated from fluctuating asymmetry in a simple partition of
	a net sum-of-squares, and geometrical details of either component
	can be inspected by traditional methods of multivariate statistical
	analysis of landmarks. We demonstrate this method in a comparison
	of wing venation asymmetry in male (haploid) and female (diploid)
	honey bees (Apis mellifera). In addition we investigate the effects
	of ploidy and inter-subspecies hybridization on asymmetry and wing
	venation abnormalities, using the subspecies A. m. mellifera, A.
	m. carnica, and the hybrid strain. Results suggest that while the
	haploid males showed a higher frequency of wing venation abnormalities
	and greater total asymmetry than the diploid females, most of the
	asymmetry difference between males and females was in the form of
	directional, not fluctuating, asymmetry. Hybrid females had a higher
	frequency of wing venation abnormalities than females of either subspecies,
	but there were no significant differences in the mean level of asymmetry
	among females of A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica and hybrid Nigra.
	Hybrid males had higher absolute frequency of wing venation abnormalities
	and asymmetry than males of either subspecies. However the mean frequency
	of venation abnormalities did not differ significantly between Nigra
	and A. m. carnica males, and mean asymmetries were not significantly
	different between Nigra and A. m. mellifera males. We discuss the
	relationship which is assumed to exist between developmental stability
	and fluctuating asymmetry in light of our result.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the degree to which various subsets of morphological
	data reflect molecular relationships is crucial for studies attempting
	to estimate genetic relationships from patterns of morphological
	variation. This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different
	human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional
	landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls
	from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided
	into anatomical regions: basicranium, tipper face, mandible, temporal
	bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around
	the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances
	were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same
	or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological
	variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular
	distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium,
	temporal bone, upper race, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest
	correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible,
	upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly
	correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology
	of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium
	appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially
	with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable
	to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic
	relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. Am. J. Hum.

  abstract = {Abstract: The success of facial approximation is thought to depend,
	at least in part, upon the "accuracy" of the constructed face. However,
	methods of accuracy assessment are varied and this range in methods
	may be responsible for the disparate results reported in the literature.
	The aim of this study was to determine if the accuracy results of
	one facial approximation were comparable across two different assessment
	methods (resemblance ratings and simultaneous face array tests using
	unfamiliar assessors) and if resemblance ratings co-varied with recognition
	responses. True-positive recognition performance from the facial
	approximation was poor (21%) while resemblance scores using the same
	facial approximation were moderately high (3 out of 5 on a five-point
	scale). These results are not, therefore, consistent and indicate
	that either different variables are being evaluated by the methods,
	or the same variable is being examined but with different weight/calibration.
	Further resemblance ratings tests of the facial approximation to
	three foil faces from the face array revealed that resemblance scores
	were similar irrespective of which face was compared, and did not
	closely correspond with the degree of recognition performance. This
	was especially the case for isolated comparisons of single faces
	to the facial approximation. Collectively, these results indicate
	that resemblance ratings are: (i) insensitive measures of a facial
	approximation's accuracy; and (ii) inconsistent with results of unfamiliar
	simultaneous face-array recognition results. These data suggest that
	familiar and unfamiliar recognition tests should be given increased
	weight in contrast to current resemblance rating tests.},

  abstract = {An accurate understanding of the spatial relationships between the
	deep and superficial structures of the head is essential for anthropological
	methods concerned with the comparison of faces to skulls (superimposition)
	or the prediction of faces from them (facial approximation). However,
	differences of opinion exist concerning: (i) the position of the
	eyeball in planes other than the anteroposterior plane and (ii) the
	canthi positions relative to the bony orbital margins. This study
	attempts to clarify the above relationships by dissection of a small
	sample of adult human cadavers (N = 4, mean age = 83 years, s = 12
	years). The most notable finding was that the eyeballs were not centrally
	positioned within the orbits as the more recent craniofacial identification
	literature expounds. Rather, the eyeballs were consistently positioned
	closer to the orbital roof and lateral orbital wall (by 1-2 mm on
	average); a finding consistent with the earlier anatomical literature.
	While these estimation errors are small ipsilaterally, several factors
	make them meaningful: (i) the orbital region is heavily used for
	facial recognition; (ii) the width error is doubled because the eyes
	are bilateral structures; (iii) the eyes are sometimes used to predict/assess
	other soft tissue facial structures; and (iv) the net error in facial
	approximation rapidly accumulates with the subsequent prediction
	of each independent facial feature. While the small sample size of
	this study limits conclusive generalizations, the new data presented
	here nonetheless have immediate application to craniofacial identification
	practice because the results are evidence based. In contrast, metric
	data have never been published to support the use of the central
	positioning guideline. Clearly, this study warrants further quantification
	of the eyeball position in larger samples and preferably of younger
	individuals.},

  abstract = {Archival sources of data are critical anthropological resources that
	inform inferences about human biology and evolutionary history. Craniometric
	data are one of the most widely available sources of information
	on human population history because craniometrics were critical in
	early 20th century debates about race and biological variation. As
	such, extensive databases of raw craniometric data were published
	at the same time that the field was working to standardize measurement
	protocol. Hrdlicka published between 10 and 16 raw craniometric variables
	for over 8,000 individuals in a series of seven catalogs throughout
	his career. With a New World emphasis, Hrdlicka's data complement
	those of Howells (1973, 1989) and the two databases have been combined
	in the past. In this note we verify the consistency of Hrdlicka's
	measurement protocol throughout the Catalog series and compare these
	definitions to those used by Howells. We conclude that 12 measurements
	are comparable throughout the Catalogs, with five of these equivalent
	to Howells' measurements: maximum cranial breadth (XCB), basion-bregma
	height (BBH), maximum bizygomatic breadth (ZYB), nasal breadth (NLB),
	and breadth of the upper alveolar arch (MAB). Most of Hrdlicka's
	measurements are not strictly comparable to those of Howells, thus
	limiting the utility of combined datasets for multivariate analysis.
	Four measurements are inconsistently defined by Hrdlicka and we recommend
	not using these data: nasal height, orbit breadth, orbit height,
	and menton-nasion height. This note promotes Hrdlicka's tireless
	efforts at data collection and re-emphasizes observer error as a
	legitimate concern in craniometry as the field shifts to morphometric
	digital data acquisition. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2011. Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss,

	is the basis of the human pigmentary system, those genes directing
	the formation, transport and distribution of the specialised melanosome
	organelle in which melanin accumulates can legitimately be called
	pigmentation genes. The genes involved in this process have been
	identified through comparative genomic studies of mouse coat colour
	mutations and by the molecular characterisation of human hypopigmentary
	genetic diseases such as OCA1 and OCA2. The melanocyte responds to
	the peptide hormones [alpha]-MSH or ACTH through the MC1R G-protein
	coupled receptor to stimulate melanin production through induced
	maturation or switching of melanin type. The pheomelanosome, containing
	the key enzyme of the pathway tyrosinase, produces light red/yellowish
	melanin, whereas the eumelanosome produces darker melanins via induction
	of additional TYRP1, TYRP2, SILV enzymes, and the P-protein. Intramelanosomal
	pH governed by the P-protein may act as a critical determinant of
	tyrosinase enzyme activity to control the initial step in melanin
	synthesis or TYRP complex formation to facilitate melanogenesis and
	melanosomal maturation. The search for genetic variation in these
	candidate human pigmentation genes in various human populations has
	revealed high levels of polymorphism in the MC1R locus, with over
	30 variant alleles so far identified. Functional correlation of MC1R
	alleles with skin and hair colour provides evidence that this receptor
	molecule is a principle component underlying normal human pigment
	variation.},

	during the Holocene. Evidence from the archaeological record is used
	to pinpoint likely episodes of genetic discontinuity. Craniometric
	data are then used to assess the likelihood of genetic change having
	occurred. Two periods of possible genetic discontinuity are identified:
	i) c. 4,000 BP, when an increase in overall population size, shifts
	in site organization and diet, and reduced mobility, were accompanied
	by reductions in stature; ii) c. 2,000 BP, when the herding of domesticates
	and the use of pottery vessels were introduced into the region. Results
	indicate that there was a decrease in cranial size and concomitant
	size-related changes in craniofacial shape between c.4,000 BP and
	3,000 BP. This was followed almost immediately by a recovery in craniofacial
	size and a return to pre-4,000 BP craniofacial shape at c. 3,000
	BP. This recovery continued gradually, extending into the herder
	period without any major shifts in morphology at 2,000 BP. It is
	suggested that the fluctuations in craniofacial size/shape were related
	to changes in environmental factors. Results obtained are consistent
	with long term continuity in South African Later Stone Age populations

  abstract = {Creating a feature-preserving average of three dimensional anatomical
	surfaces extracted from volume image data is a complex task. Unlike
	individual images, averages present right-left symmetry and smooth
	surfaces which give insight into typical proportions. Averaging multiple
	biological surface images requires careful superimposition and sampling
	of homologous regions. Our approach to biological surface image averaging
	grows out of a wireframe surface tessellation approach by Cutting
	et al. (1993). The surface delineating wires represent high curvature
	crestlines. By adding tile boundaries in flatter areas the 3D image
	surface is parametrized into anatomically labeled (homology mapped)
	grids. We extend the Cutting et al. wireframe approach by encoding
	the entire surface as a series of B-spline space curves. The crestline
	averaging algorithm developed by Cutting et al. may then be used
	for the entire surface. Shape preserving averaging of multiple surfaces
	requires careful positioning of homologous surface regions such as
	these B-spline space curves. We test the precision of this new procedure
	and its ability to appropriately position groups of surfaces in order
	to produce a shape-preserving average. Our result provides an average
	that well represents the source images and may be useful clinically

	One entrenched notion is male facial features that are affected by

	may be particularly revealing as it is purported to be an honest
	indicator of male fitness. Increased testosterone may impose an immunocompetence
	handicap on the bearer and only the best males can carry this handicap.
	To date, tests of this theory have been indirect, and have relied
	on digital manipulations that represent unrealistic continuums of
	masculine and feminine faces. We provide a much more direct test
	by manipulating digitally male faces to mimic known shape variation,
	caused by varying levels of testosterone through puberty. We produced
	a continuum of faces that ranged from low to high levels of testosterone
	in male faces and asked women to choose the points on the continuum
	that appeared most attractive and most physically dominant. Our data
	indicate that high testosterone faces reveal dominance. However,
	there is no evidence of directional selection for increased (or decreased)
	testosterone in terms of attractiveness to the opposite sex. We discuss
	the relevance and applicability of evolutionary interpretations of
	our data and, contrary to predictions, provide evidence of stabilizing
	selection acting on testosterone through mate preferences.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for determining the minimal non-rigid
	deformation between two 3-D surfaces, such as those which describe
	anatomical structures in 3-D medical images. Although we match surfaces,
	we represent the deformation as a volumetric transformation. Our
	method performs a least squares minimization of the distance between
	the two surfaces of interest. To quickly and accurately compute distances
	between points on the two surfaces, we use a precomputed distance
	map represented using an octree spline whose resolution increases
	near the surface. To quickly and robustly compute the deformation,
	we use a second octree spline to model the deformation function.
	The coarsest level of the deformation encodes the global (e.g., affine)
	transformation between the two surfaces, while finer levels encode
	smooth local displacements which bring the two surfaces into closer
	registration. We present experimental results on both synthetic and
	real 3-D surfaces.},

  abstract = {Abstract The chin, or mentum osseum, is one of the most distinctive
	anatomical traits of modern humans. A variety of hypotheses for the
	adaptive value of the chin have been proposed, ranging from mechanical
	stress resistance to sexual selection via mate choice. While the
	sexual selection hypothesis predicts dimorphism in chin shape, most
	biomechanical hypotheses preclude it. Therefore determining the presence
	or absence of significant sexual dimorphism in chin shape provides
	a useful method for differentiating between various adaptive hypotheses;
	however, this has yet to be done due to a lack of quantitative data
	on chin shape. The goals of this study are therefore: (1) to introduce
	a new method for quantifying chin shape and (2) to determine the
	presence or absence of sexual dimorphism in chin shape in a diverse
	sample of modern humans. Samples were drawn from recent human skeletal
	collections representing nine geographic regions. Outlines of mentum
	osseum contours were quantified using elliptical Fourier function
	analysis (EFFA). Fourier coefficients were analyzed using principal
	components analysis (PCA). Sexual dimorphism in chin shape was assessed
	using PC loadings in the pooled geographic sample, and statistically
	significant differences were found. These findings provide the first
	quantitative, morphologically based evidence in support of adaptive
	hypotheses that predict dimorphism in chin shape, including the sexual
	selection hypothesis. Am J Phys Anthropol 143:417-425, 2010. © 2010

	the paradigm of non-parametric statistics. The estimation is localized

	of the individual surfaces embedded in the vectorial space of extended
	normal vector fields. This allows to compute deformations and averages
	of surfaces. It consists in estimating the soft-tissue surface over

	nose projection prediction guidelines; and continued refinement of
	the methods in the 15 years following their foremost publication.
	As Gerasimov cannot be consulted to resolve these issues, we provide
	solutions via one of his five former principal students. This includes
	clarification of Gerasimov's method and use of soft tissue depths;
	the constitution of his modeling mastic; methods used for nose projection
	prediction; and refinements made to his methods following their primary

	recreate the face from unknown human skeletal remains, and to elucidate
	the antemortem facial appearance. This requires accurate assessment
	of the skull (age, sex, ancestry, etc.) and thickness data. However,
	additional information is required to reconstruct the face as the
	information obtained from the skull is limited. Here, we aimed to
	examine the information from the skull that is required for accurate
	facial reconstruction. The human facial profile is classified into
	3 shapes: straight, convex, and concave. These facial profiles facilitate
	recognition of individuals. The skeletal classes used in orthodontics
	are classified according to these 3 facial types. We have previously
	reported the differences between Japanese females. In the present
	study, we applied this classification for facial tissue measurement,
	compared the differences in tissue depth of each skeletal class for
	both sexes in the Japanese population, and elucidated the differences
	between the skeletal classes.},

	A face, from a data bank which has previously digitised facial surfaces,
	is then placed over the skull in the form of a mask and the skin
	thickness is altered to conform with the underlying skull. The advantage
	of the computer method is its speed and flexibility. We have shown
	that the computer method for reconstructing a face is feasible and
	furthermore has the advantage over the manual technique of speed
	and flexibility. Nevertheless, the technique is far from perfect.
	Further facial thickness data needs collecting and the method requires

	deutschen Anthropologie/Völkerkunde in NS-Verbrechen verstrickt waren
	ist wenig überraschend, hantierten sie doch mit Rassentheorien aller
	Art. Unklar war aber, inwieweit sie schon vor 1933 für die NS-Ideologie
	empfänglich waren. Diese Arbeit untersucht daher die führenden Wissenschaftler
	der Weimarer Zeit, die an deutschen Unis lehrten. Das Ergebnis ist
	erschütternd: Bei den meisten paarten sich primitivste Rassenvorurteile
	mit pseudowissenschaftlichen Verlautbarungen., Abstract: Noch heute
	herrscht in der Wissenschaftsgeschichte zuweilen die Tendenz, Rassenideologien
	und Rassentheorien auf am Rande stehende politische Extremisten und
	Pseudo-Wissenschaftler zurückzuf hren. Dies betrifft unter anderem
	auch die Frage, welchen theoretischen Beitrag die Wissenschaft -
	und in diesem Kontext insbesondere die Lehre vom Menschen, also die
	Anthropologie oder Humanbiologie - für die Rassenlehren im Nationalsozialismus
	geleistet hat und inwieweit sie eine geistige Mittäterschaft an den
	Massenmorden trägt. Bis vor einigen Jahren war die Ansicht verbreitet,
	dass die unpolitische und passive Wissenschaftsgilde unter dem Druck
	des totalitären Systems gestanden habe und machtlos hätte zusehen
	müssen, wie Politiker und Ideologen die Anthropologie für ihre rassenpolitischen
	Zwecke missbrauchten. Die neuesten wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse
	deuten dagegen auf eine weit über die nationalsozialistische Epoche
	hinaus führende Kontinuität rassistischer Denkmuster in der deutschen
	Anthropologie hin. Diese Arbeit möchte mit einer historischen Analyse
	der deutschen Anthropologie einen Beitrag an die gerade erst einsetzende
	Aufarbeitung der Geschichte des Fachs leisten. Kürzlich sind zwar
	ergiebige Biografien einiger führender Anthropologen und Rassentheoretiker

	blue and brown iris colour for forensic intelligence},
  journal = {Forensic Science International: Genetics},
  volume = {In Press, Corrected Proof},
  pages = {--},
  abstract = {The IrisPlex system consists of a highly sensitive multiplex genotyping
	assay together with a statistical prediction model, providing users
	with the ability to predict blue and brown human eye colour from
	DNA samples with over 90% precision. This [`]DNA intelligence' system
	is expected to aid police investigations by providing phenotypic
	information on unknown individuals when conventional DNA profiling
	is not informative. Falling within the new area of forensic DNA phenotyping,
	this paper describes the developmental validation of the IrisPlex
	assay following the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods
	(SWGDAM) guidelines for the application of DNA-based eye colour prediction
	to forensic casework. The IrisPlex assay produces complete SNP genotypes
	with only 31pg of DNA, approximately six human diploid cell equivalents,
	and is therefore more sensitive than commercial STR kits currently
	used in forensics. Species testing revealed human and primate specificity
	for a complete SNP profile. The assay is capable of producing accurate
	results from simulated casework samples such as blood, semen, saliva,
	hair, and trace DNA samples, including extremely low quantity samples.
	Due to its design, it can also produce full profiles with highly
	degraded samples often found in forensic casework. Concordance testing
	between three independent laboratories displayed reproducible results
	of consistent levels on varying types of simulated casework samples.
	With such high levels of sensitivity, specificity, consistency and
	reliability, this genotyping assay, as a core part of the IrisPlex
	system, operates in accordance with SWGDAM guidelines. Furthermore,
	as we demonstrated previously, the IrisPlex eye colour prediction
	system provides reliable results without the need for knowledge on
	the bio-geographic ancestry of the sample donor. Hence, the IrisPlex
	system, with its model-based prediction probability estimation of
	blue and brown human eye colour, represents a useful tool for immediate
	application in accredited forensic laboratories, to be used for forensic
	intelligence in tracing unknown individuals from crime scene samples.},

  abstract = {A new era of [`]DNA intelligence' is arriving in forensic biology,
	due to the impending ability to predict externally visible characteristics
	(EVCs) from biological material such as those found at crime scenes.
	EVC prediction from forensic samples, or from body parts, is expected
	to help concentrate police investigations towards finding unknown
	individuals, at times when conventional DNA profiling fails to provide
	informative leads. Here we present a robust and sensitive tool, termed
	IrisPlex, for the accurate prediction of blue and brown eye colour
	from DNA in future forensic applications. We used the six currently
	most eye colour-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
	that previously revealed prevalence-adjusted prediction accuracies
	of over 90% for blue and brown eye colour in 6168 Dutch Europeans.
	The single multiplex assay, based on SNaPshot chemistry and capillary
	electrophoresis, both widely used in forensic laboratories, displays
	high levels of genotyping sensitivity with complete profiles generated
	from as little as 31pg of DNA, approximately six human diploid cell
	equivalents. We also present a prediction model to correctly classify
	an individual's eye colour, via probability estimation solely based
	on DNA data, and illustrate the accuracy of the developed prediction
	test on 40 individuals from various geographic origins. Moreover,
	we obtained insights into the worldwide allele distribution of these
	six SNPs using the HGDP-CEPH samples of 51 populations. Eye colour
	prediction analyses from HGDP-CEPH samples provide evidence that
	the test and model presented here perform reliably without prior
	ancestry information, although future worldwide genotype and phenotype
	data shall confirm this notion. As our IrisPlex eye colour prediction
	test is capable of immediate implementation in forensic casework,
	it represents one of the first steps forward in the creation of a
	fully individualised EVC prediction system for future use in forensic
	DNA intelligence.},

	and a number of facial angles and dimensions (measured from lateral
	radiographs). Multivariate statistical analysis of the skeletal variables
	in a group of 50 subjects led to the recognition of six independent
	factors determining facial shape, i.e, 1) cranial base length, 2)
	lower facial height, 3) cranial base flexure and prognathism, 4)
	facial width, 5) mandibular length, and 6) upper facial height. In
	29 of these subjects, the cross-sectional areas of the jaw muscles
	were determined, and correlations between these areas and the scores
	on the above-mentioned factors were calculated. It appeared that
	the cross-sectional areas of temporalis and masseter muscles correlated
	positively with facial width, whereas the areas of masseter and both
	pterygoid muscles did so with mandibular length. It has been shown
	experimentally that a decrease in jaw muscle size in various animals
	likewise has an effect on facial width and mandibular length. Our
	results therefore support the hypothesis that in man too the jaw
	muscles affect facial growth and partly determine the final facial
	dimensions. They also hint that the role of each muscle is different.}

	anatomically accurate facial models focusing on skeletal detail.
	This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the system
	and illustrates its accuracy and reliability with a blind study using
	computed tomography (CT) data of living individuals. Three-dimensional
	models of the skulls of two white North American adults (one male,
	one female) were imported into the computer system. Facial reconstructions
	were produced by two practitioners following the Manchester method.
	Two posters were produced, each including a face pool of five surface
	model images and the facial reconstruction. The face pool related
	to the sex, age, and ethnic group of the target individual and included
	the surface model image of the target individual. Fifty-two volunteers
	were asked to choose the face from the face pool that most resembled
	each reconstruction. Both reconstructions received majority percentage
	hit rates that were at least 50% greater than any other face in the
	pool. The combined percentage hit rate was 50% above chance (70%).
	A quantitative comparison of the facial morphology between the facial
	reconstructions and the CT scan models of the subjects was carried
	out using Rapidform 2004 PP2-RF4. The majority of the surfaces of
	the facial reconstructions showed less than 2.5 mm error and 90%
	of the male face and 75% of the female face showed less than 5 mm
	error. Many of the differences between the facial reconstructions
	and the facial scans were probably the result of positional effects
	caused during the CT scanning procedure, especially on the female
	subject who had a fatter face than the male subject. The areas of
	most facial reconstruction error were at the ears and nasal tip.}

	To test the accuracy of these coordinate data, we recorded the same
	28 landmarks directly on the Bosma mandibles using a Polhemus 3Space
	digitizer. The directly digitized landmarks serve as a gold standard
	upon which to evaluate the eTDIPS data. Standard deviations of landmark
	placement using eTDIPS show a greater degree of variation compared
	to the data gathered using the digitizer, although this error is
	more heavily concentrated in certain types, of landmarks. All possible
	linear distances between unique pairs of landmarks were calculated,
	and like linear distances were compared between the two data collection
	methods. The absolute difference for all like linear distances ranged
	from 0.001-3.9 mm (mean = 0.377 mm SD = 1.136), with the eTDIPS data
	being consistently larger than the digitizer coordinates. This study
	demonstrates that landmark coordinate data can be reliably collected
	from digital CT images of the human mandible. We define a set of
	mandibular landmarks useful in evaluating the effects of craniofacial
	disorders, growth and other biological processes. 2003 Wiley-Liss,

	maxillary alveolar process were collected from a cross-sectional
	cranial sample of mixed sex and ancestry (male and female; African-
	and European-American), partitioned into three age groups (young
	adult = 18-39; middle-aged = 40-59 years; and elderly = 60+ years).
	Each facial region's semilandmarks were aligned into a common coordinate
	system via generalized Procrustes superimposition. Regional variation
	in shape was then explored via a battery of multivariate statistical
	techniques. Age-related shape differences were detected in the orbits,
	zygomatic arches, and maxillary alveolar process. Interactions between
	age, sex, and ancestry were also identified. Vector plots revealed
	patterns of superoinferior compression, lateral expansion, and posterior
	recession depending on the population/subpopulation, location, and
	age groups examined. These findings indicate that adult craniofacial
	curvature shape is not static throughout human life. Instead, age-related
	spatial modifications occur in various regions of the craniofacial
	skeleton. Moreover, these regional alterations vary not only through
	time, but across human populations and the sexes. Am J Phys Anthropol

	PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear
	multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that
	it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness
	from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and
	even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable
	property that the precision of the model parameters improves with
	the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This
	article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool
	in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying
	model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics
	are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters.
	Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity
	Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship
	(QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret
	and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing
	of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling
	of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

  abstract = {It is commonly accepted that some of the latest dates for Neanderthal
	fossils and Mousterian industries are found south of the Ebro valley
	in Iberia at ca. 36 ka calBP (calibrated radiocarbon date ranges).
	In contrast, to the north of the valley the Mousterian disappears
	shortly before the Proto-Aurignacian appears at ca. 42 ka calBP.
	The latter is most likely produced by anatomically modern humans.
	However, two-thirds of dates from the south are radiocarbon dates,
	a technique that is particularly sensitive to carbon contaminants
	of a younger age that can be difficult to remove using routine pretreatment
	protocols. We have attempted to test the reliability of chronologies
	of 11 southern Iberian Middle and early Upper Paleolithic sites.
	Only two, Jarama VI and Zafarraya, were found to contain material
	that could be reliably dated. In both sites, Middle Paleolithic contexts
	were previously dated by radiocarbon to less than 42 ka calBP. Using
	ultrafiltration to purify faunal bone collagen before radiocarbon
	dating, we obtain ages at least 10 ka 14C years older, close to or
	beyond the limit of the radiocarbon method for the Mousterian at
	Jarama VI and Neanderthal fossils at Zafarraya. Unless rigorous pretreatment
	protocols have been used, radiocarbon dates should be assumed to
	be inaccurate until proven otherwise in this region. Evidence for
	the late survival of Neanderthals in southern Iberia is limited to
	one possible site, Cueva Antón, and alternative models of human occupation
	of the region should be considered.},

	detection of colonic polyps on the basis of volumetric features and
	to assess its accuracy on the basis of colonoscopy, the standard.MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: Computed tomographic (CT) colonography was performed
	in patients with use of standard bowel cleansing, air insufflation,
	and helical scanning in supine and prone positions. The colon was
	extracted from volumetric data sets generated from transverse CT
	sections. Volumetric features characterizing polyps were computed
	at each point in the extracted colon. Polyps were detected by means
	of hysteresis thresholding and fuzzy clustering followed by a rule-based
	test on the basis of feature values. Locations of the detected polyps
	were compared with those detected at conventional colonoscopy.RESULTS:
	Forty-one cases were analyzed: nine cases with polyps and 32 without
	polyps. Each case with polyps had one polyp of clinically important
	size (six were 5-9 mm; three, 10 mm). Thus, there were 82 volumetric
	data sets, 18 included polyps. Eighty-nine percent (16 of 18) of
	the polyps were detected. Each of the two false-negative findings
	was detected in the other position; thus, 100% of polyp cases were
	detected, with 2.5 false-positive findings per patient. The false-positive
	findings were similar to those due to common perceptual errors. Most
	of the false-positive findings were easily distinguishable from true
	polyps by experienced radiologists.CONCLUSION: The CAD scheme has
	the potential to depict polyps with high sensitivity and an acceptable
	false-positive rate.},

  abstract = {A new approach for constructing deformable continuous medial models
	for anatomical structures is presented. Medial models describe geometrical
	objects by first specifying the skeleton of the object and then deriving
	the boundary surface corresponding to the skeleton. However, an arbitrary
	specification of a skeleton will not be "valid" unless a certain
	set of sufficient conditions is satisfied. The most challenging of
	these is the non-linear equality constraint that must hold along
	the boundaries of the manifolds forming the skeleton. The main contribution
	of this paper is to leverage the biharmonic partial differential
	equation as a mapping from a codimension-0 subset of Euclidean space
	to the space of skeletons that satisfy the equality constraint. The
	PDE supports robust numerical solution on freeform triangular meshes,
	providing additional flexibility for shape modeling. The approach
	is evaluated by generating continuous medial models for a large dataset
	of hippocampus shapes. Generalizations to modeling more complex shapes
	and to representing branching skeletons are demonstrated.},
